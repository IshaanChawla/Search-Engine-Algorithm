Melee.</em></div> </figcaption></figure>
<p>Underneath a bakery in Chinatown, hundreds of fingers work rubber off joysticks. The hard clacking of plastic on plastic fills the plain hallways, audible above rowdy voices and aggressive chiptune.</p>
<p>Some 50 people, a few scratching beards, some dragging along chaperones, have gathered in a Chinese community center to punish each other’s digits with brightly colored characters from Nintendo’s glory days. Harried organizers shout match ups over the chaos of huddled bodies and working controllers. For the next 12 hours, the new location of gaming store Nebulous NYC transforms the whitewashed basement into a coliseum. Here, <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> is pure, vicious sport. The crowd calls for blood.</p>
<p>“Usually we’ve been getting a good 70 kids here,” says organizer Anthony King as he runs between tables sagging under the weight of tube televisions.</p>
<p>For more than a year, King and several other volunteers have hosted tournaments focused around the game that launched the wildly popular <em>Smash</em> competitive scene—2001’s <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em>. In the 14 years since the game's release, the <em>Melee </em>community exploded in both numbers and sophistication. Bolstered by social media and the rise of live streaming platform Twitch, rules for international play are carefully constructed and fiercely debated by hordes of players online. Top-tier smashers—as devotees call themselves—compete for several-thousand-dollar pots, sustain themselves off monetized Twitch streams, and command tens of thousands of followers on Twitter. Major US tournaments draw players from as far as Sweden, Japan, and Chile. And although the first crop of competitive smashers is now pushing into their 30s, some vets still turn up for even these more casual Saturday tournaments.</p>
<p><em>Melee </em>isn't the newest <em>Smash</em> title. It's not even the second most recent. Though sequels tend to cannibalize their predecessors in the e-sports arena, so far this game has managed to survive. But every tournament scheduled for this summer's EVO 2015 besides <em>Melee</em> is the most recent edition in its respective series. The irrepressible need for buzz, the requisite attention from gaming companies, and sequels’ typically updated, not overhauled, gameplay combine to favor newer games time and time again. It’s a trend that few games, if any, have been able to withstand without eventually succumbing to irrelevancy.</p>
<p>That's why Sundays with Nebulous has <em>Melee </em>fans feeling uncertain about the future.</p>
<h2>The new game in town</h2>
<p>This day, players furiously button-mash Gamecube controllers linked up to tube TVs as well. Their wires, however, lead back to Wii Us, and whirring inside is the franchise’s newest incarnation, <em>Super Smash Bros. for Wii U </em>(aka <em>Smash 4)</em>. Six months since the game’s console release, the players—some as young as 11—already approach the cartoon battles like military tacticians.</p>
<p>“It’s closer to being a chess game than <em>Melee</em>,” King said a few days after the weekend tourney. “<em>Melee</em> is more punish-based, it’s almost overwhelming. In <em>Melee</em> once you have an interaction, that interaction can last for a long time. In <em>4</em>, you’ll have more interactions lasting for shorter. The game ends up being a series of separate, isolated events.”</p>

Brawl.</em> But all are unique, their individual gameplay formulas tweaked and retweaked in the interstitial years. Many still consider <em>Melee</em> the core of competitive <em>Smash,</em> and, on paper, it still dominates. Apex 2015 hosted a total of 1,037 <em>Melee </em>participants, the event’s largest such tournament to date. But <em>Smash 4</em> was only 200 participants behind—its singles bracket counted 837 entrants. Thanks to the newest game, competitive <em>Smash</em> in all its incarnations is having a moment.</p>
<p class="p1">“The game's looking to be great over the years, in terms of variety, growth, and spectator-wise,” said Apex’s reigning champion, Chilean smasher Gonzalo “ZeRo” Barrios.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s early in the lifespan of <em>Smash 4</em>, but its competitive play has proved quietly revolutionary in another sense. Nintendo of America, sensing big marketing potential for their newest release, began sponsoring tournaments ahead of and following <em>Smash 4</em>’s rollout (Apex included). Two years earlier, the corporation attempted to prevent EVO, the country’s largest fighting game tournament, from hosting <em>any</em> <em>Smash</em> events in 2013.</p>
<p>Despite all the momentum for <em>Smash </em>at-large, this development has prompted a new round of hand-wringing for competitive players. To outsiders, <em>Smash 4</em> is just another <em>Smash</em> buffed and polished to match the latest hardware. Yet at Nebulous and elsewhere, crossover between the new contender and the old standard is rare—as is dialogue between players. Barrios’ February victory was soured with boos and chants of “Melee!” by the crowd, annoyed by the wait to see Apex’s main event. To them, the newest game is just a novelty. And in competitive <em>Smash</em>, novelties aren’t taken too kindly.</p>
<p>So less than a year into the newest generation of <em>Smash</em>, a rift within the community between the <em>Smash 4</em> avant-garde and <em>Melee</em> traditionalists is deep and getting deeper. What competitive <em>Smash</em> ought to and will look like going forward—united, divided, or doomed altogether—remains unclear.</p>
<p>This is precisely where the legacy of <em>Brawl</em>—the game separating <em>Melee</em> and <em>Smash 4</em> in the series chronology—looms largest.</p>
<p>Prior to <em>Brawl’s</em> release in 2008, <em>Smash</em> players united under the banner of <em>Melee</em>, and the series’ competitive potential was finally breaking into the mainstream. Major League Gaming picked up <em>Melee</em> in 2004, and competitors battled for $10,000 pots. But with announcement of <em>Brawl</em>, there was a growing sense that <em>Melee</em> would become obsolete. MLG pre-emptively dropped <em>Melee</em> in 2007 to make way for the new game. EVO picked up <em>Melee</em> when MLG dropped it, only to also replace it with <em>Brawl</em> a year later.</p>
<p>The hotly anticipated <em>Brawl</em> wasn’t what <em>Melee</em>-bred smashers hoped it would be. The game targeted casual gamers to an even greater degree, offering slower and quirkier (see it's like it's guaranteed KOs) gameplay. It drove a wedge between <em>Melee</em> diehards and those attracted to the new game. Tensions flared, and many of the highest-level players accelerated toward retirement. <em>Melee’s</em> upward momentum effectively halted. In fact, after <em>Brawl</em> arrived on North American shores on March 9, 2008, not a single national <em>Melee</em> tournament was held for 364 days.</p>
<p>Obviously given its popularity today, <em>Melee</em> ultimately restarted itself and survived. <em>Brawl</em> was dropped from the EVO circuit after 2008, and MLG followed suit in 2011. But the damage was done.</p>

<h2>New tactics</h2>
<p>By every traditional metric, <em>Smash 4</em> has been a monster hit. The Wii U version sold 3.4 million copies in less than two months and nearly single-handedly saved Nintendo’s beleaguered eighth-generation console’s holiday sales. November 2014 included the Wii U’s best sales week since it launched two years earlier; December 2014 became the best single month.</p>
<p>Critically, the game has been no less impactful. It boasts an impressive 92 on Metacritic. Ars editor Andrew Cunningham <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/11/review-new-smash-bros-is-the-best-reason-yet-to-buy-a-wii-u/">called <em>Smash 4</em></a> “the best reason yet to buy a Wii U,” going as far as to suggest <em>Melee</em> diehards would find enough to like to plunge into the new game. Critics praised its ease for newcomers, its depth for old timers, and the fact that even after all the years the thing was still fun as hell.</p>
<p>That last part has always been key for the franchise’s long-time <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/12/smash-bros-creator-doubts-hell-work-on-another-sequel/">Director Masahiro Sakurai.</a> The developer has repeatedly said <em>Smash </em>is meant to be a party game, something to be played on the couch rather than in packed tournament halls. His antipathy for the whole competitive approach to the game is well-known.</p>
<p>“Personally, I feel that if you want to play a fighting game seriously, there are other competitive fighting games that are more suited to that,” he told Japanese game magazine <em>Nintendo Dream</em> in late 2014. “People like that could have fun playing those. If you play <em>Smash Bros.</em> seriously as a competitive game, the game itself has no future.”</p>
<p>His last two games have taken this logic to heart. <em>Melee’s</em> speed has been integral to its appeal as a competitive game. Top players can mash up to six to seven inputs a second, on par with <em>Starcraft</em>. But while breakneck pace made for great competitive play, Sakurai himself said the game was “too difficult.” So its direct sequel, <em>Brawl</em>, took the exact opposite approach. It’s a plodding, more curious game. The title earned widespread acclaim from critics and casual gamers, but many competitive smashers revolted.</p>
<p>Even today <em>Brawl</em> continues to be spat at by most <em>Melee</em> players, who describe it as sluggish and poorly balanced. And, accordingly, the game has not been treated kindly by tournament history. Just 176 people signed up for <em>Brawl</em> singles at the most recent Apex. It took a squad of modders to entirely rehash the game for it to gain any traction competitively. That resulting product, Project M (PM), sits closer to <em>Melee</em> in form and adding additional characters and stages, but it resides in legal gray area. Nintendo has come down hard, going as far as to block discussion of the mod on Miiverse channels. In November of last year, Apex organizers axed PM from its roster altogether. Nintendo joined the tournament as an official sponsor two months later.</p>
<p>“<em>Brawl</em> was a very good game in my eyes,” said Richard “Keitaro” King, a smasher and organizer who runs the popular Rush Hour Smash YouTube channel. “But it suffered from tripping, low hit stun, the ability to stall, and characters that over-centralized the game, including infinites (guaranteed KO combos). A lot of these features called for stale gameplay in the later years of the game.”</p>
<p>Despite the outcry, <em>Smash 4</em> followed in the same “fun” mold. On the surface, it’s faster than <em>Brawl</em> and slower than <em>Melee</em>, but it’s far closer to the former in pace and form. Many of the advanced techniques commonplace in <em>Melee</em> were stripped out. As a result the new game converted few from the <em>Melee</em> camp. But for the generation of smashers who came of age with <em>Brawl</em>, this was a step up—fresher, more balanced, more rewarding of risks.</p>
<p>“This game takes the basic <em>Brawl</em> engine and instead of changing it a lot, fixes the major complaints from a competitive standpoint,” said Samuel “Dabuz” Buzby, a New York-based smasher who finished second behind ZeRo at Apex. “As a result <em>Smash 4</em> feels, given the current metagame, more balanced and more rewarding to players with strong fundamentals compared to <em>Brawl</em>.”</p>
<p><figure class="video" style="width:100%"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="100%" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/12vAUFA8O2E?start=0&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption class="caption"><div class="caption-text">The 2015 Apex tournament finals for <em>Super Smash Bros. Wii U.</em></div> </figcaption></figure><br />
At their core, <em>4 </em>and <em>Brawl</em> share a common tactical play, one focused on discrete attacks and counters rather than long strings of combos. Players will launch a one-two punch, retreat to neutral ground, and re-initiate an attack rather than punish another player hit after hit after hit. But the gameplay changes from <em>Brawl</em> discovered over the last six months have caused the metagame—the collection of strategies, counter strategies, character, and stage assessments that define competitive play on a more conceptual level—to change from month to month, maybe even week to week.</p>
<p>“The game is so raw and so new, it’s really just the beginning,” said smasher Tyrell “Nakat” Coleman, still streaming over his popular Twitch account.</p>
<p>Players point to stronger shielding and a more fluid combo and movement system, plus a more balanced cast of characters across the board. There's also the game’s curious “rage mechanic,” which increases attacks’ knockback the more lives a character has lost.</p>
<p>But the most important strategical tweaks, players say, are alterations to the off-stage game. Characters’ fall speeds are even slower than <em>Brawl</em>, and lag upon landing is worse. At the same time, repeat ledge grabs no longer prompt invulnerability, preventing players from strategically blocking out recovering opponents.</p>
<p>“That seems like a kind of casual change, but in a sense it’s not,” said Coleman. “It opened up a new dynamic that many players six months in are still not taking advantage of.”</p>
<p>Combined with the strongest jump moves yet for the series, this causes the space on the peripheries of the box—places that a player could rarely, if ever recover from—to become critical strategic points when compared to earlier <em>Smash</em>.</p>
<p>“You’ll see players do even crazier stuff off the edges that would have been totally dangerous in <em>Melee</em>, <em>Brawl,</em> or <em>64</em>, but in <em>4, </em>they are totally safe,” said King. “Recoveries have been boosted so much, off-stage interaction is so much more important.”</p>

      Amazingly in-depth article for Ars. I'm impressed. <br /><br />That said, Melee is not the sole exception when it comes to older games surviving. Although dropped from Evo after the release of the [poorly received] remake, 1994's Super Street Fighter II Turbo still has a strong competitive scene both in the US and overseas, although not anywhere near the crowds that its modern sequel ([Ultra] Street Fighter IV) does.

      Some of us consider Melee the usurper and Smash 64 to be the One True Title. I was surprised and disappointed the article didn't touch on that at all, but otherwise this is surprisingly in-depth and much appreciated coverage!

      Excellent article.  <br /><br />Melee is one of the greatest accidents to ever happen.  What was designed to be a robust sequel to a popular (and still excellent)  n64 game,  ended up being one of the deepest, most demanding fighting games ever made.  The fact that it's older than the streaming sites hosting it says volumes.  <br /><br />I lost smash 4, and the variety of characters it provides,  but when I want to see the finest Smash Bros has to offer,  I'm watching a melee tournament.

      This is a quite extreme dramatization of the rift between games. There was a lot more tension in the era of brawl.  With continued growth in melee tournaments and continued developer support in Smash 4, there is little fear of either game going under. At this point its simply an issue of two different groups existing in the same space. <br /><br />Melee players would prefer the games, with vastly different mechanics, to be treated as separate entities and not be expected to watch or interact with games they may not enjoy playing or watching.  The Apex chants were a result of players of one game being forced to watch gameplay they don't enjoy, way past the scheduled start of their own game, to save their seating.   Smash 4 and brawl players who have benefited immensely from the resurgence in melee popularity are the ones claiming that smash players are part of one cohesive unit.

      Since there are quite a few errata, thought I would list them so you could correct them. Feel free to upvote this if you like the idea:<br /><br />Errata #1<br />&quot;November 2014 was the Wii U’s best sales month since it launched two years earlier.&quot; - Incorrect. I can think of 2 things you might be mixing up here. <br />1. In the US, Nintendo of America reported the best Wii U sales &quot;week&quot; with the release of Smash Wii U in the US. <br />2, The best sales month for the Wii U in the US was in December of 2014, not November.<br /><br />Errata #2:<br />Julian “KTails” Martinez - I'm pretty sure you're talking about JTails? I've never heard of a &quot;KTails&quot; in the Smash scene, and I figure the &quot;J&quot; stands for his first name.

The 3DS version has shipped over 6M+ units and is still the lead platform for Smash in terms of sales. I'd say you should explain this.<br /><br />Edit: (Copying from my later post)<br />Wow, thanks for the super quick response! It seems like the article is repeated twice now?<br /><br />Here are some other errata:<br /><br />part in question:<br />&quot;and nearly single-handedly saved Nintendo’s beleaguered eighth-generation console’s holiday sales&quot;<br /><br />Also I wouldn't ever use the word &quot;saved&quot; in terms of Wii U sales. I think what you're looking for is the word &quot;boosted&quot;. &quot;Heavily boosted&quot; is also fair game..<br /><br />Also, I'm pretty sure &quot;The Wii U version sold 3.4 million copies in less than two months&quot; should say shipped.

      When people watch sports they want to see the outliers, the flukes, the freaks, the pros. And they don't want to see tictactoe, they want highspeed highprecision technical mastery.<br /><br />That said, the world isn't tournaments. The population isn't outliers. There are many purposes for a game. Tictactoe, tee-ball, flag football, they're not going anywhere.<br /><br />So I guess the question is How Much Money is involved, when devs consider forking work to include tournament support. Smash4's FG mode disabled customs/equipment and axed some levels, for instance.

There was a lot more tension in the era of brawl.  With continued growth in melee tournaments and continued developer support in Smash 4, there is little fear of either game going under. At this point its simply an issue of two different groups existing in the same space. <br /><br />Melee players would prefer the games, with vastly different mechanics, to be treated as separate entities and not be expected to watch or interact with games they may not enjoy playing or watching.  The Apex chants were a result of players of one game being forced to watch gameplay they don't enjoy, way past the scheduled start of their own game, to save their seating.   Smash 4 and brawl players who have benefited immensely from the resurgence in melee popularity are the ones claiming that smash players are part of one cohesive unit.</div><br /><br />The problem of course is that Melee and Smash 4... don't have &quot;vastly different mechanics.&quot; At the very least, not from a high-level perspective. While they are most assuredly different, they are still quite similar. They certainly share more similarities than say, Melee does with Street Fighter. The differences between Melee and Smash 4 are like the differences between SSF2 Turbo and USF4. Significant, to be sure, but not &quot;vastly different&quot;.<br /><br />The issue is the animosity and disjoint nature between the two camps. While you get a lot of Super Turbo proponents, they generally also watch and/or play USF4. They may prefer one, but that's not to the <span style="font-style: italic">exclusion</span> of the other. Whereas there are a lot of Melee players who consider Smash 4 to be unwatchable and not worthy of their interest.<br /><br />And of course, hate begets hate. The people who enjoy Smash 4 begin to hate Melee because of the Melee players who not only dislike Smash 4, but actively despise the fact that it's even a part of their scene. Even though, as a game in the same series, with similar core gameplay structure, it has every right to be.<br /><br />That rift is not good. A divided community is not helpful to the progression of the game as a whole.

I meant &quot;high-level perspective&quot; as in &quot;from viewed very far away, so most of the details are not visible&quot;.<br /><br />From that perspective, &quot;different neutral and combo games&quot; are non-existent. It's about what a lay person would notice immediately upon playing the game. They'd notice basic mechanics like recovery moves, smash attacks, the relationship between health and how far you go when you get hit. That's &quot;high level&quot;.<br /><br />The &quot;neutral game&quot; and &quot;combo games&quot;? Those are much lower-level. They certainly affect the flavor of the work and dictate how a competitive player plays. But overall? The similarities outweigh the differences.<br /><br />As to your specific comparison, think again. Sit a low-skilled SF player in front of MK, and they won't have any more idea of what to do than a player who's only ever played DiveKick. Sit a low-skilled SSB4 player in front of Melee, and they'll understand at least some of the basics, like edge guarding and so forth. Oh sure, it'll require lots of changes in their playstyle.<br /><br />But they'll be more functional than a DiveKick player.<br /><br />Also, what &quot;many&quot; would argue is irrelevant; that's how people will view it, so that's how it has to be dealt with. They are part of the same community, because that's how everyone else sees them. And however much some of them might want to divorce themselves from the others, that's simply not going to be possible.<br /><br />Ignoring reality doesn't make it go away.

      I've always been fundamentally against the &quot;combo&quot; system that is apparently loved in SSB2, less possible in SSB4. You can see it at its worst in a game like Marvel vs Capcom 3.

I think it's much more interesting when, say, after one throw, the victim could do one of two common things or three other outlandish things - one or more of those actions could save them from another easy attack, the others might not; and it's all mind-games played out in short term.<br /><br />Basically, hit-stun when you get hit makes sense, but shouldn't be the requirement for a good strategy.<br /><br />(One funny announcer moment from a Melee video; &quot;Did he just...calmly *walk* right up to Jaden and punch him? Ohh man. Those are some mind-games right there.&quot; The joke being, &quot;Jaden&quot; was likely expecting something sudden to react off of, like a dodge-roll, a jumping attack to close the distance, etc)

They're about player skill stratification.<br /><br />The idea is that, because defense can never be perfect, if both players are actually trying to be aggressive, sooner or later one player will get hit. A player with greater mechanical skill (ie: can do those combos better) will be able to more effectively punish such a mistake. Therefore, no matter how much strategy you have, how much pure thinking and tactics you employ, you must have a certain basic amount of mechanical skill before you are even competitive.<br /><br />The reason for such stratification is that... strategy eventually runs out. The reason Tic-Tac-Toe isn't interesting for anyone over the age of 5 is because it is easily solved. Mechanical skill makes it possible for you to broaden the point where the game is &quot;solved&quot;, to the point where there isn't one answer anymore. Lower skilled players can't some strategies that high skill players can, because even if they manage to create an opening, they can't actually punish it very well due to the lack of mechanical skill.<br /><br />Furthermore, combos allow the chance for players to fail at mechanical skill. You can drop combos. Skilled players will drop fewer combos than less skilled players, but even the best will drop the soap every now and then. This also helps alleviate the Tic-Tac-Toe problem, since even if there was some optimal strategy, someone can still screw it up and put themselves in a bad situation due to a failure of mechanical skill.<br /><br />Strategy is important in fighting games (and any competitive game). But, just like sports, knowing what to do and actually being able to do it regularly and correctly every time are two different things. Any Monday-morning quaterback can say &quot;pass the ball to the wide-receiver, you moron!&quot; Can you throw a football while at a dead sprint, at a target also at a dead sprint 40 yards away, while two 300+ pound linebackers with bad attitudes are barreling down at you?<br /><br />Combos and similar elements of mechanical skill are how e-sports achieve this sort of thing. It's an important element of any e-sport.<br /><br />That's not to say that you can't achieve similar levels of mechanical skill without combos specifically. But you need <span style="font-style: italic">something</span>.

They're about player skill stratification.<br /></div><br /><br />They can be depending on the game. In SF4 sometimes you don't want to spend super meter or ultra meter on your combos and instead save it for later, maybe you prefer to end with a hard knockdown to set something up for their wake up, maybe you want to carry them to the corner or maybe deal as much raw damage as possible. Heck sometimes you might want to drop the combo intentional aka reset to try for more damage too, plenty of options and no dial a combos.<br /><br />Those are all strategic options that come after a guaranteed hit, without followupsin the form of combos you're left with something like Dive Kick. A great game that's all about footsies but kind of lacking some of the deeper strategies of other fighting games.<br /><br />Edit: the skill stratification is a contentious issue. Once you get enough skill at the game you're playing totally different mind games with your opponent but the learning curve and practice required to get there are massive. If the bar is lowered then more people can get into the real meat of the game but there's a lot of push back here and it's not easy to solve.

      I'm going to dispel the rampant misinformation in this thread.<br /><br />First, re: accessibility and high-level similarities between Smash 4 and Melee. The two key differences that Melee has which are noticeable to a layperson are its speed in all regards and combos. These two factors alone make spectating Melee a discrete and different experience: it's what allows for hype combos and exciting play, which are key factors to a spectator sport. It's why you have combo videos like <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPbVqAzD7lg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPbVqAzD7lg</a><!-- m -->. You don't see that in Smash 4.<br /><br />Second, re: combos. The &quot;Smash system&quot; of combos is actually the opposite of MvC. MvC is more similar to SF and other traditional 2D fighters. The greatest innovation of Melee was the introduction of DI, or directional influence. DI affects the trajectory you are sent when you are hit. Every attack in Melee has a knockback angle and a knockback power (determined as roughly 1/3 of damage dealt). When you are hit, you are first put into freezeframes (also known as hitlag), the number of which is also determined by the damage of the move you are hit by. Between the first and last frame of hitlag, you may input a direction on the analog stick. The game will shift the position of your character about half a character length based on where you point the stick. We call this first DI input &quot;Smash DI.&quot; <br /><br />Then, on the last frame of hitlag, the game reads the analog stick position a second time. If the direction is perpendicular-away from the trajectory of the move, you can alter your knockback angle by 18 degrees (maximum allowed for DI). Lesser angles will modify this trajectory less. So while Smash DI shifts your character's current position, this DI, which we call &quot;Trajectory DI&quot; or TDI, actually affects the trajectory you fly. Using DI enables you to escape combos because there <span style="font-weight: bold">is no guarantee</span> where exactly you'll be after the first move lands. This means that you can alter your knockback in <span style="font-style: italic">every single hit of the combo</span>. Furthermore, there is a third DI that is also read on the last frame of hitlag, called &quot;Automatic Smash DI.&quot; I don't need to get into this now. The point is, however, combos in Melee are the farthest thing from automatic. They require constant yomi and reaction from both sides: those getting combo'd and those doing the comboing. Additionally, this doesn't mean someone should just hold into the stage the entire time. When getting combo'd, the optimal strategy is to hold down and away, because it makes followups much more difficult. However, players must watch out for a combo finisher move, because then they must reverse this DI to in and up, so as to not reach the blastbox. Do you see how deep these interactions can become?<br /><br />tl;dr People always comment on issues they know nothing about. That's fine, but don't pretend you're actually knowledgeable if you're not.

      The attitude that Nintendo has had in recent years to hardcore gamers really hasn't done them any favors. It speaks to how good their first party games are that there are still YouTubers and pro-gamers out there pursuing those titles even though Nintendo has fought at every step to make that hard for them. While just about every other game with a competitive scene has gone to very significant ends to keep people playing and interested even after months or years, Nintendo just tells people that they're doing it wrong if they want to play competitively. <br /><br />And I know that doesn't really have that much bearing on Smash, or at least on Melee anyway, but it just annoys me to see Nintendo take that stance towards their customers.

      Considering how complex the Smash Scene is, this was a pretty nice article, good work. <br /><br />Some minor corrections would be:<br />The &quot;Rage&quot; mechanic is based on how much damage currently have, not by stock count.<br /><br />Fall speeds are actually higher in Smash 4 than Brawl, but it's the better recoveries, weaker attacks (Almost requiring Rage to kill), and new ledge mechanics that make people live forever in Smash 4. Brawl actual had people live until a high percent as well (Due to momentum canceling), but it was easier to build up a bit of damage. <br /><br />The Smash subreddit is /r/smashbros , not /r/smashbrothers.  <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz Animated" /><br /><br />Brawl actually had a decent competitive scene for years, until Melee had a second wind and Project M started taking attention away as the newer, shinier, better-balanced game, albeit as a mod. <br /><br />I'm just glad that Project M even got a mention, which is depressingly rare for a major fan mod with over a million downloads. May want to link <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.projectmgame.com">http://www.projectmgame.com</a><!-- m --> , though. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

If one of the games were branded a different franchise, I believe they'd be treated the same as Street Fighter vs. Mortal Kombat.

Let me play Samus and I'll feel so restricted that I wont want to play with you anymore. <br /><br />Let us play Smash 4 and we can either be competitive or get 1-6 other people together and have an amazing time.

      What I don't get is why the games can't coexist. Look at rally racing. Successful rally drivers often competed in several categories of races. Group B drivers (in the old days) actually came from all over. Some of them competed in the Dakar, which is a completely different race, but added to the prestige of the driver.<br /><br />Maybe rank the games from hardcore to less hardcore in categories A-B-C and just let everyone play whatever category they want. If they only want to compete in one, okay, go ahead. Others could compete for every game.<br /><br />Imagine a tournament composed of all the games, where it's the total number of wins/points over all the games that decides victory. It would be amazing because some players are going to go all-in on one game and others will try to go all-round.

Evo is usually the biggest and most prestigious fighting tournament and is kind of analogous to the Olympics, you'll see lots of fighting games played there and multiple different versions of each game for certain games in side tourneys. They'll also have their own rules that are different to what some people might expect, like in the Olympics basketball didn't until recently(AFAIR, might still be different) follow NBA rules but instead international rules which were different, Smash does a similar thing at Evo and has different rules to Smash in other tournaments.<br /><br />Different games are different though and attract different players even in the niche of fighting games, killazys already made a great post on how Smash is very different to other fighting games but to keep with the Olympics analogy why would you think someone who's good at the 100m dash would also be good at marathons, I mean they're both just running right? Similar thing happens here and so players generally work really hard on their niche game and generally aren’t top tier in other games. Sure they can be good at multiple games but I can't think of one single player that's really dominant in multiple fighting games.<br /><br />As to the Dakar analogy lots of well known pro fighting game players also do expensive money matches that are first to 100 or the like, or go in other tournaments/leagues like Topanga which can be a totally different format(round robin, best of seven instead of 3 IIRC?), team matches, single elim tourneys, etc. Where I see the difference here is it sounds more like you're asking drivers to come to an even and do go carts, open wheelers, stock cars and also a rally even in one event, then tally up who averaged the most points and declare them the winner. That would make for a cool event sure but I doubt too many of the fans of motosports would really get behind it.

      Further proof that Nintendo is woefully out-of-touch.  Most other companies who make fighting games try to balance the needs of the casual and the hardcore.  Nintendo outright dismisses one of the groups and tells them to go to other fighting games.

I'm not particularly good at any of the smash games so this doesn't really surprise me. It also sounds totally ridiculous on the face of it, but then people online still scream at each other about the best Pokemon generation on a regular basis... Any Arsians partake in the smash competitive scene? Would love their take x

      I'm so happy Super Smash Bros. Wii U has a &quot;for glory&quot; game mode online so the no-fun-allowed people can be separated from the folks who want to play the game for what it is, a party game, and with all the game features enabled (like moving maps and items).

      I played the 64 and Melee version to death, skipped brawl, and found the new one to be strangely different. It just doesn't feel the same-- slower perhaps and with a heaping load of &quot;other stuff&quot; added in. It feels more like a party game now.

      From what I've seen, competitive scenes vary greatly at a regional level.  When I was growing up, my region had strong competitive scenes for Mario Kart 64, Melee, Call of Duty (the original), and UT 2K4.  <br /><br />Additionally, if you look hard enough, anyone who wants to play any game competitively, whether it be Melee, Brawl, or Smash 3DS/Wii U, can find a circuit, especially now that stable internet connections are so prevalent.  For example, I was active in a Halo(PC) clan ladder through 2007.<br /><br />EDIT: Found a typo

      I love Evo. I watch it every year from morning to whenever they stop airing and I watch all streams if possible. The most boring one for me was Smash. IO just don't get it. I can't make sense of what;s going on onscreen. I'm sure the game is fun to play but I don't find it fun at all to watch. Just not my cup of competitive fighting game tea I guess.

The two key differences that Melee has which are noticeable to a layperson are its speed in all regards and combos. These two factors alone make spectating Melee a discrete and different experience: it's what allows for hype combos and exciting play, which are key factors to a spectator sport. It's why you have combo videos like <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPbVqAzD7lg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPbVqAzD7lg</a><!-- m -->. You don't see that in Smash 4.</div><br /><br />As pointed out in the article, something similar could be said for the relationship between StarCraft and SC2. Old SC1 hands will swear up and down that SC2 is &quot;a discrete and different experience&quot;, that SC1 allows for &quot;exciting play&quot; that SC2 does not.<br /><br />SC2 still supplanted it.<br /><br />Also, those things may be somewhat noticeable, but they're fairly minor to the lay person. They can clearly see that SSB4 and Melee are the same <span style="font-style: italic">kind</span> of game, which is a discrete kind of game from, say, SF. Melee may be faster, but they still have most of the same basic elements and mechanics: knocking people out of the arena, edge guarding, shielding, etc.<br /><br />In short, the differences are exactly the kinds of differences you would expect in a <span style="font-style: italic">sequel</span>. They're the differences between Super Turbo and USF4. Sequels each have their own unique elements, their own identity and quirks. But they're still part of the same series, different variations on the same core gameplay.<br /><br />So stop acting like it isn't.</div><br /><br />Going by your logic, SF, MvC, KoF, KI, Injustice, Skullgirls, and MK are all in the same series. One long flat stage, a health bar, super meter, timed rounds, set combos memorized as opposed to freestyled, and lots of corner play. You cannot &quot;run away,&quot; only backdash. You guard by holding away (in the new MKX this is different).<br /><br />This also makes Guilty Gear, Blazblue, and P4A all the same series as well. Anime style, airdash, setplay, canceled moves, freestyle combos because of different character weights, and burst to get out of combos.<br /><br />Your argument simply doesn't hold water because fighting games as a genre can't be compared to RTS. The differences I'm describing aren't the differences between BW and SC2, they're more like the differences between a Corvette and a McLaren. They're both sports cars, right?<br /><br />Basically, if Melee had completely different art and characters from Smash 4, and a different name, I don't think people would argue they are in the same series. They would say that they are in the same genre.

Wii U has a &quot;for glory&quot; game mode online so the no-fun-allowed people can be separated from the folks who want to play the game for what it is, a party game, and with all the game features enabled (like moving maps and items).</div><br /><br />Yep.  Items, moving maps, 4-8 players.  That is what makes Smash and how it is designed towards.  Smash 1v1 kinda reminds me of speed run categories and the like.    <br /><br />Never understood how people could get upset over the Wii version since 1v1 is not their design goal.<br /><br />Games do need that appeal to allow casuals to get into it but also have that in depth level up play to keep the hardcores playing.  But when your design goal is a casual party game, don't get upset when they don't include the in depth play.
