        Welcome to Codecademy, the website and mobile service of Ryzac, Inc. (“Codecademy,” “we,” or “us”).
        This page explains the terms by which you may use our online and/or mobile services, website, and software provided on or in connection with the service (collectively the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Terms of Service Agreement (“Agreement”) and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the Codecademy <a href="/fr/policy">Privacy Policy</a> , whether or not you are a registered user of our Service. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (“Users”).
      </p>

      <p>
        PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li><h3 class="margin-top--2 margin-bottom--1">Use of Our Service</h3></li>
        <p>
          Codecademy provides an online interactive platform for taking and creating coding classes.
        </p>

        <ol type="A">
          <li><h5 class="margin-bottom--1">Eligibility</h5></li>
          <p>
            This is a contract between you and Codecademy. You must read and agree to these terms before using the Codecademy Service. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service. If you are a child under 13 years of age, we may need your parent or guardian’s consent before allowing you to use the Service. Supplemental terms and conditions may apply to some Services, such as rules for a particular competition, promotion, service or other activity, or terms that may accompany certain content accessible through the Services. Supplemental terms and conditions will be disclosed to you in connection with such competition, service or activity. Any supplemental terms and conditions are in addition to these terms and, in the event of a conflict, prevail over these terms. The Service is not available to any Users previously removed from the Service by Codecademy.
          </p>

          <li><h5 class="margin-bottom--1">Codecademy Service</h5></li>
          <p>
            Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the Service for your personal, noncommercial use only and as permitted by the features of the Service. Codecademy reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the Service and the Codecademy Content (as defined below). Codecademy may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason.
          </p>

          <li><h5 class="margin-bottom--1">Codecademy Accounts</h5></li>
          <p>
            Your Codecademy account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. By connecting to Codecademy with a third-party service (for example, Facebook or Twitter), you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may never use another User’s account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You must notify Codecademy immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Codecademy will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by changing the settings in your “account settings” page. By providing Codecademy your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences in your “account settings” page. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.
          </p>

          <li><h5 class="margin-bottom--1">School Accounts</h5></li>
          <p>
            If you are a School seeking to utilize the Service for educational purposes, you may create accounts for your Students via our Pupil Dashboard. Once the accounts have been created, Teacher will be able to view the progress and completion statistics of students via the Pupil Dashboard. By submitting Student information to Codecademy, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant, to Codecademy a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license during the term of the Agreement to use, transmit, distribute, modify, reproduce, display, create derivative works of, and store the Student data solely for the purposes of (i) providing the Services as contemplated in these Terms, and (ii) enforcing its rights under the Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain clear and verifiable parental consent before receiving personal information from children under 13. Because Codecademy provides the Service to School to benefit and enhance the School’s curriculum, CODECADEMY RELIES ON SCHOOL TO OBTAIN AND PROVIDE APPROPRIATE CONSENT, IF NEEDED, TO COLLECT STUDENT INFORMATION. School represents and warrants that School has the authority to provide consent for Codecademy to collect information from students before allowing students under 13 to access our Service, and that School has provided appropriate disclosures to students and parents regarding School’s sharing of Student Data with service providers such as Codecademy. We recommend that School provide a copy of our Privacy Policy to parents and guardians.

The arbitration will be conducted in New York County, New York, unless you and Codecademy agree otherwise. Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
