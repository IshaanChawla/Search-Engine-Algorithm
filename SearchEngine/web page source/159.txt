    <p>On Monday the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2015/05/ftc-requests-bankruptcy-court-take-steps-protect-radioshack?utm_source=govdelivery">sent a letter</a> to the bankruptcy court presiding over RadioShack's supervised asset sell-off suggesting a compromise that would allow RadioShack to sell its database of information from 117 million customers.</p>
<p>The sale of the data—which includes names, addresses, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and purchase histories—has caused concern among consumer protection advocates. The states of Tennessee and Texas <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/03/despite-privacy-policy-radioshack-customer-data-up-for-sale-in-auction/">recently filed objections</a> to RadioShack's plan to find a buyer for its database, saying that the company promised in various privacy policies that it would not resell customer data to third parties. AT&amp;T and Apple also objected to the sale of portions of the database, saying that that information actually belongs to them and not to RadioShack as per RadioShack's business agreements with those companies.</p>
<p>According to FTC <a href="//cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/150518radioshackletter.pdf">Consumer Protection Director Jessica Rich</a> (PDF), RadioShack could find a way to appease consumer advocates by taking a look at a bankruptcy case from 2000 involving retailer Toysmart. In that case, Toysmart had wanted to sell off its database of customer data, but after some pushback from the FTC it agreed to certain limitations on the sale of the database. For example, the buyer could not buy the customer database alone—it had to receive it bundled in with the sale of other assets like trademarks or Web content. In addition, the information had to be sold to a business similar to Toysmart and that buyer had to agree to honor the privacy policy that Toysmart had pledged to its customers.</p>
<p>“We have similar concerns about the potential deceptive nature of the transfer of customer information in this case,” Rich wrote in her letter. “We recognize, however, that bankruptcy presents special circumstances, including the interest in allowing a company to get back on its feet—or alternatively, to marshal remaining assets for its creditors—consistent with any promises made to customers.” Rich continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>As in <em>Toysmart</em>, our concerns about the transfer of customer information inconsistent with privacy promises would be greatly diminished if the following conditions were met:</p>
<ul>
<li>The customer information is not sold as a standalone asset;</li>
<li>The buyer is engaged in substantially the same lines of business as RadioShack;</li>
<li>The buyer expressly agrees to be bound by and adhere to the terms of RadioShack’s privacy policies as to the personal information acquired from RadioShack; and</li>
<li>The buyer agrees to obtain affirmative consent from consumers for any material changes to the policy that affect information collected under the RadioShack policies.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Rich added that if RadioShack can't meet these conditions, it ought to receive "affirmative consent" from each of its customers in the database before selling their information to a third party.</p>
<p>The FTC's compromise suggestion does not seem to address the concerns of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/05/apple-asks-court-to-block-the-sale-of-some-radioshack-data/">Apple and AT&amp;T</a>, which are claiming rights to information gathered through sales of iPhones and AT&amp;T services respectively. Last week, hedge fund Standard General made a winning bid of $26.2 million to buy RadioShack's name, its customer data, and its remaining assets. A hearing is scheduled for May 20 to determine whether the customer data can be sold to the hedge fund.</p>

      I think radioshack should be forced to abide by their terms. They said &quot;We won't sell your data&quot;, not &quot;We won't sell your data unless we go out of business&quot;. The compromise represents at least some constraints, but Radioshack should have to hold up their end of the bargain.

Oh, sure, they might have been able to buy a  cell phone elsewhere, but in some places the only AT&amp;T outlet was Radio Shack. Regardless, once they're told their data wouldn't be sold, that creates a contract. It's a pretty big deal to renig on a contract like this and, frankly, bankruptcy ought not be allowed to disrupt a non-financial agreement such as this.

      Screw every asshole involved in the attempt to buy or sell this data.  They should not be allowed to go back on their word.  The official FTC stance should be, &quot;No, you douchebags, you are not allowed to sell Radio Shack's customer data.&quot;<br /><br />Seriously, if that's how you make a living, selling customer data without consent, you are crap and need to rethink some things in your life.

      How can companies force us to be bound to their EULA but it is even a question that they are bound to the will not sell?<br /><br />They could have just not said they won't sell the data. But they knowingly agreed to not selling it.<br /><br />This should be a fairly straightforward dispute.<br /><br />If they are allowed to sell the data it should be the strongest indication yet that the consumer has zero rights and the corporations get to change any agreement as they see fit, when they see fit, without informing the party to which the agreement was made and without first mentioning this ability to change said agreement.<br /><br />[Sarcasm]<br />It is too bad there aren't any government organizations designed to protect consumers.<br />[/sarcasm]<br /><br />Edit: typos

Bankruptcy is about renegotiating contractual obligations that cannot be met due to insolvency. Saying that all contractual obligations get thrown out the window because simply because breaking one contract can provide an opportunity to to meet financial obligations to others is going too far. The contracts up for renegotiation are those that they can't meet, and nothing about Radio Shack's financial state prevents them from upholding their privacy policy, so they should be held to it.

I don't think it puts any extra onus on Radioshack and its creditors if we hold them to the agreements they made to us as a consumer. I shouldn't need an advocate to defend my rights as defined by the contract that Radioshack itself imposed, the bankruptcy court should unequivocally block the sale of that information.

For example: a business built on land zoned for office space doesn't get to just declare that they will be converting/selling the site to a chemical waste dump simply because they are in bankruptcy.

In a bankruptcy go ahead and sell the infrastructure, sell the equipment, sell the real estate.  Customer data should not be allowed to be sold unless the entire business is being purchased in a merger/acquisition.  Customer data alone, should not be an item on the bankruptcy auction block.  It's that simple.</div><br />That's essentially what the FTC is dictating. It has to be sold to someone like them buying more than just the data. That could be what Standard General is doing: name, customer data, and remaining assets, depending on what those assets are. We'll see if they balk at having to uphold the existing terms on that data. Well, that's assuming that it's a similar enough business to even get the attempt.<br /><br />Basically, don't think of it as a sale of data, think of it as a post-bankruptcy acquisition.</div><br /><br />At the end of the day, the agreement included the clause that the information would not be sold. There were no addendums or exceptions, just a simple agreement not to be sold. This does not undergo some magical transmutation when bankruptcy is declared, Radioshack made the agreement, Radioshack expected customers to abide by the terms of that agreement; and had a customer broken one of the provisions you can bet your ass Radioshack would have tried some legal means of penalizing that person. They don't get a free pass because their bankrupt to violate the agreement they expected others to follow. <br /><br />If the agreement did not include a do not sell clause, I wouldn't agree with the decision but it would be tough luck for those that did, voluntary or not. In this case Radioshack itself inserted the language into the agreement. Not some third party, not some after the fact agreement. Radioshack designed and implemented the agreement, and its tough shit to the investors that can't turn around and sell it.

      about 20 years ago I went to buy a $2 battery at mylocal radio shack. I pulled out $2 in cash, no taxi needed in Oregon, but they wouldn't let me pay unless I gave them information. so I said it was a stupid policy I may have no reason to need my name and address email to sell me a $2 battery. they looked at me like I was nuts. upshot: not nuts! hey!

You wouldn't be so dismissive if you lost all those dollars!</div><br />I voted you up because I think you raise a good point, but I think you are taking it too far. Bankruptcy is about renegotiating contractual obligations that cannot be met due to insolvency. Saying that all contractual obligations get thrown out the window because simply because breaking one contract can provide an opportunity to to meet financial obligations to others is going too far. The contracts up for renegotiation are those that they can't meet, and nothing about Radio Shack's financial state prevents them from upholding their privacy policy, so they should be held to it.</div><br />Precisely.  It's simply not a salable asset because they promised never to sell it.  If this sort of agreement is subject to being tossed out in bankruptcy, we need to collectively raise a <span style="font-weight: bold">i[]HUGE[/i]</span> stink with Congress to mandate changes to the law around this.  This is as big a deal, in my view, as SOPA was.<br /><br />Currently, in the US, a database is owned by the entity which compiled it.  This is a matter of settled law.  If promises made not to ever sell that database cannot be enforced simply because of insolvency, then we need legislation to fix that.  We simply have no choice but to provide out data to others in many cases.  Are my medical records subject to sale by a doctor who's declaring bankruptcy?  What about my phone metadata in a similar circumstance?  This won't stop just with Radioshack's bankruptcy proceeding, I assure you.

It's about debts the company owes.  Like the money they owe landlords.  Or the money they owe their cleaning crews.  <br /><br />Anyone foolish enough to invest in radio shack has already lost their shirt.

In a bankruptcy go ahead and sell the infrastructure, sell the equipment, sell the real estate.  Customer data should not be allowed to be sold unless the entire business is being purchased in a merger/acquisition.  Customer data alone, should not be an item on the bankruptcy auction block.  It's that simple.</div><br />That's essentially what the FTC is dictating. It has to be sold to someone like them buying more than just the data. That could be what Standard General is doing: name, customer data, and remaining assets, depending on what those assets are. We'll see if they balk at having to uphold the existing terms on that data. Well, that's assuming that it's a similar enough business to even get the attempt.<br /><br />Basically, don't think of it as a sale of data, think of it as a post-bankruptcy acquisition.</div><br /><br />At the end of the day, the agreement included the clause that the information would not be sold. There were no addendums or exceptions, just a simple agreement not to be sold. This does not undergo some magical transmutation when bankruptcy is declared, Radioshack made the agreement, Radioshack expected customers to abide by the terms of that agreement; and had a customer broken one of the provisions you can bet your ass Radioshack would have tried some legal means of penalizing that person. They don't get a free pass because their bankrupt to violate the agreement they expected others to follow. <br /><br />If the agreement did not include a do not sell clause, I wouldn't agree with the decision but it would be tough luck for those that did, voluntary or not. In this case Radioshack itself inserted the language into the agreement. Not some third party, not some after the fact agreement. Radioshack designed and implemented the agreement, and its tough shit to the investors that can't turn around and sell it.</div><br />Is there anything wrong with a company being acquired and the buyer having access to the data? I realize that's not what happened here, but you use such absolute terms, it makes me think that's also not okay. That sort of thing happens all the time.<br /><br />Next step, what if a company buys another company, and sells off part of it. They couldn't sell your data, not allowed to sell it to a third party, but they can still hold onto it themselves.<br /><br />How about if a company divests parts of itself (not the data, of course) prior to being acquired? How much of a company is considered &quot;the company&quot; in bankruptcy?<br /><br />I'm just saying it's not as clear cut as an acquisition, but it's certainly in the same ballpark, and the FTC's statement suggests the same. It's not ideal, but it's not as far out of line as many people are reacting.
