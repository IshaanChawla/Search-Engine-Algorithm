            <p>I recently attended a class on estimation. While I believe in the value of estimating I am extremely wary of making too big of science out of something that is inherently imprecise. The course was two hours long which I found to be a perfect amount of time to remind everyone the process and benefits that go into estimation but without over analyzing and over thinking it.</p>

<h2 id="thealltoocommonexample">The all too common example</h2>

<p>How often do you see or have a conversation between a project manager and developer like this?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>PM</strong>: "Can you give me an estimate of the time necessary to develop feature xyz?" <br>
  <strong>Programmer</strong>: "One month" <br>
  <strong>PM</strong>: "That's far too long, we've got only one week!" <br>
  <strong>Programmer</strong>: "I need at least three" <br>
  <strong>PM</strong>: "I can give you two at most" <br>
  <strong>Programmer</strong>: "Deal!" <br></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uh oh. What do you think is going to happen? If you find yourself in these situations take a quick look at the definitions and relationships of an <strong>estimate</strong> vs. <strong>target</strong> vs. <strong>commitment</strong> about halfway down <a href="http://www.methodsandtools.com/archive/archive.php?id=79">this page here</a> so you and your team can have more productive conversations in the future. It's a short couple of paragraphs.</p>

<p>Fortunately for my team we do not have too many of the above, ludicrous, conversations, so we didn't have to dwell on this topic.</p>

<h2 id="asuccinctgraphthatresultedinverydifferentconclusions">A succinct graph that resulted in very different conclusions</h2>

<p>During the training a graph was shown to us to stress the importance of having a precise estimate. I crudely reconstructed it in MS Paint for your viewing pleasure:</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2014/12/underestimation-vs-overestimation-in-software-development-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 60%">Graph adopted from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Estimation-Demystifying-Developer-Practices/dp/0735605351?tag=netinstr-20">McConnell, Steve, Software Estimation: Demystifying the Black Art</a></span></p>

<p>The point of this was to show that having a precise estimate is what you want to aim for. <strong>I disagree. In fact, I would argue that we should aim somewhere to the right of a 100% accurate estimate</strong>. </p>

<p>Why? Estimation is an inherently imprecise science. Though there are many, many ways (perhaps more <a href="http://www.computing.dcu.ie/~renaat/ca421/LWu1.html">than</a> <a href="http://www.cs.odu.edu/~price/cs451/Lectures/04mgmt/costest/costest_htse1.html#costest_htsu3.html">necessary</a>) to become better at estimating, there will always be a cloud of uncertainty. I agree that <strong>to be 100% precise on every estimate is best on paper but in practice we'll never get there[1]</strong></p>

<p>Not only that, but <strong>the cost of underestimating is huge</strong>. We went through some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>The project could fail (worst case scenario).</li>
<li>Late nights at the office</li>
<li>Stress and anxiety</li>
<li>The project could be delayed</li>
<li>The quality suffers</li>
<li>The cost increases</li>
<li>Customers get upset</li>
</ul>

<p>The distinction between bounded and unbounded results is important. <strong>When people overestimate, the feature will still get done, just at the expense of wasted time. When people underestimate, it's possible that the feature will <em>never</em> get done.</strong></p>

<p>Later in the training do you know what was cited as one of the reasons for errors in estimating?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Too much chaos in the project to derive accurate estimates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you know what causes chaos in a project? Behind schedule projects! This sounds like a perfect recipe for disaster, and this phenomenon is known as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback">positive feedback loop</a> (which despite its name, is not always a positive thing).</p>

<p>Another big takeaway in the estimation training was to always give a range. I'm not going to argue on the benefit/cost of doing that, but if you want more information, perhaps <a href="http://spin.atomicobject.com/2009/01/14/making-better-estimates-range-estimates/">start here</a>. As an example to my point, let's use a range to estimate a feature that turned out to be underestimated:</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2014/12/underestimating-cost.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And an example where it turns out we overestimated:</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2014/12/overestimating-cost.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The area under the curve[2] which represents <strong>effort, cost and schedule is drastically less when you overestimate than when you underestimate your features.</strong></p>

<p>Again, I agree that 100% estimation accuracy is ideal, but the costs of being wrong are too high in practice.</p>

<p>How often is your team staying late? How often are projects running behind? This line buried in the middle of this <a href="http://www.benjamincburns.com/2014/11/30/from-hacker-to-hospice-in-seven-weeks.html">scary, heart-wrenching article</a> was especially poignant to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Per usual in software development, the project was behind schedule. It was no time for anyone on that team to be slacking off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hate this idea that's so pervasive in our industry. I reject this mentality. <strong>It's not fair for anyone that software projects are so "typically behind schedule"</strong>.</p>

<p>With all these thoughts in mind[3][4], it seems to make the most sense to aim for precise estimation accuracy, but more importantly, <strong>err on overestimating.</strong> </p>

<hr />

<p>Hate estimating? Love estimating? Do you think it's helpful or useless, or somewhere in between? There is plenty of discussion over  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2q6x39/a_developers_thoughts_on_giving_estimates/">here</a> or in the comments section of <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/01/pc-version-of-grand-theft-auto-v-pushed-back-to-march/?comments=1">this article</a> (A preview: <strong>most developers don't like estimates at all, for many good reasons</strong>.) </p>

<hr />

<p><span style="font-size: 80%">[1]: There's plenty of discussion around the trade off between estimating / time it takes to estimate. My training instructor said that there are rapidly diminishing returns after estimating a feature more than three times.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 80%">[2]: Otherwise known as an integral in calculus</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 80%">[3]: I also found this little fact in <a href="http://www.methodsandtools.com/archive/archive.php?id=79">this article on estimating</a> that states:</span></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-size: 80%">...developers already tend to be 20%-30% too optimistic [in estimating]</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 80%">which I certainly believe anecdotally. In other words developers generally <em>underestimate.</em> <a href="http://help.fogcreek.com/7624/estimating-software-tasks">Fog creek</a> actually makes the case to ignore business needs in order to avoid falling into this trap of underestimating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 80%">[4]: I am aware that if I consistently overestimate, and then my project manager takes that result and overestimates on top of that, and then her/his project coordinator takes that and overestimates that value, the final estimation can be drastically overestimated. I <em>wonder</em> if that's actually so bad in practice vs. the alternative.[5]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 80%">[5]: I <em>propose</em> that someone somewhere should inflate their estimates by some amount, and the developer is a good candidate since they're prone to underestimating.</span></p>
