    <p>The push for renewable energy has led to the generation of biofuels from cellulose-rich biomass, algae, and crops. Currently, crop-based biofuels are limited to those derived from agricultural products: corn, soybean, rapeseed, and surgarcane. An increase in the demand for crop-based biofuels will require either an increase in the amount of agricultural land or an increase in crop production on existing land.</p>
<p>An expansion of agricultural land can only occur if whatever is presently on the land is sacrificed—this can mean abandoned lands, pastures, or natural systems. Natural systems such as grasslands and forests store large amounts of carbon; if turned into agricultural lands, this carbon could be released into the atmosphere. Though crops also store carbon as biomass during their growth, regular harvests do not allow for long-term carbon storage. From a climate perspective, this could be problematic.</p>
<p>Do the carbon and nitrogen emissions that result from the deforestation and land-use intensification offset the environmental benefits of displacing fossil fuels? One way to assess this issue is by calculating carbon payback times, which represent the period over which the total greenhouse gas savings due to the displacement of fossil fuels equals the initial losses in ecosystem carbon stocks caused by land conversion.</p>
<p>Recently, an international team of scientists improved this process through the development of a greenhouse gas payback time (GPBT), which assesses the impact of biofuel production on multiple classes of greenhouse gas emissions. The GPBT essentially indicates the number of years it takes before the greenhouse gas savings due to biofuels equals the initial losses of carbon and nitrogen stocks from the original ecosystem.</p>
<p>The greenhouse gas payback times depend on the amount of carbon dioxide and dinitrogen oxide emitted into the atmosphere due to the removal of biomass both when space is cleared for agricultural lands and when fertilizer is applied during cultivation. When calculating the GPBTs, the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted due to the production of bioenergy and the use of fossil energy are both considered. Finally, the amount of bioenergy gained through biofuel production, which depends on the feedstock yield, feedstock-to-biofuel conversion efficiency, and energy content of the biofuel, plays a role.</p>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that greenhouse gas emission involved with production of crop-based biofuels varies depending on the type of crop that is cultivated, the location, and the intensity of farm management practices. However, most previous studies have been focused on specific countries and regions; the limited scope of these investigations has kept the analysis from effectively addressing global biofuel productions. To address this issue, these scientists derived spatially explicit, high-resolution GPBTs that accounted for the conversion of natural vegetation to feedstock cropland.</p>
<p>GPBTs were calculated for the production of bioenthanol from corn grain, sugarcane sucrose, and winter wheat grain, as well as the production of biodiesel from rapeseed and soybean oil. A global crop model was used to simulate spatially explicit cultivation of biofuel crops. The influence of farming intensification for individual crops, which occurs by increased labor input or use of technology, was also assessed. Finally, the influence of geographic location, management regime, and crop type on the GPBTs was evaluated.</p>
<p>The types of crop-based biofuel production studied in this investigation produce large quantities of byproducts that emit greenhouse gases. An energy-based method was used to allocate the appropriate amount of greenhouse gas emissions to these byproducts. Without this allocation, GPBTs are on average 61 percent shorter.</p>
<p>When starting from natural vegetation, GPBTs varied anywhere from one to 162 years, depending on the crop, management intensity, and location. GPBTs were longest in the tropical regions of South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. The scientists found a median GPBT of 51 years when converting tropical moist forest to cropland for biofuels and 27 years when replacing tropical grasslands. For the temperate and boreal regions, the median GPBT was between six and 20 years, depending on what types of temperate vegetation were replaced with biofuel cropland.</p>
<p>Next, the team looked at how farming intensification reduced the GPBTs. When looking at GPBTs under no-input farming, rapeseed-based biodiesel production yielded the shortest GPBTs, with a median of 21 years. The longest GPBTs came from bioethanol production from sugarcane under no-input farming, where the median was 60 years. GPBTs increased for all crops in the tropical regions. In contrast, under high-input farming, the median GPBTs for all crops was 79 percent shorter compared with no-input farming having a median value of 45 years. Under these conditions, corn and winter wheat yielded the lowest median GPBTs of six years and eight years, respectively.</p>
<p>Overall, the scientists found more variability in the GPBTs than previous studies, which they think can be attributed to the inclusion of more regions with relatively low yields due to their global simulation. This study underscores the importance of using appropriate assessment tools to predict future trends in order to guide biofuel policy.</p>

      Thanks for the interesting article. As someone with a biology background, I am skeptical of biofuels for some of the reasons outlined in this article. In order to create the bio- you need to sacrifice land and a lot of energy to create the -fuel. You can't just add bio- related prefix to a word to make it &quot;green&quot; and sustainable. Ultimately the crops that go into the fuels just raises commodity prices for the rest of us.<br /><br />Two easy short term alternatives is reduce fuel usage by reducing driving and increasing efficiency.<br /><br />The harder long term is demanding increasingly strict efficiency standards and coming up with alternative fuels (such as electricity from sustainable sources).<br /><br />Still, my thought has always been if we can put a man on the moon we can come up with some type of new ways of powering cars. We just have to make people excited about it like the next Apple gadget. <br /><br />However, unlike the new tech gadgets anything dealing with gas, oil, and cars will have to go through the entrenched industries who are more than happy with the status quo.

      Personally, I'd say the way to go for biofuels would be some types of waste like those from the paper industry and alga rather than diverting part of the agriculture from food to crops for fuel. Fuel from corn is among the worse of those offenders.

      Note that a very high part of the claims of progress on GHG reduction is made by governments claiming raping forests for firewood is carbon neutral and methane emissions from leaking gas pipes and production is negligible. Factor in the real science and Germany has made no progress at all in ite AGW war while doubling power rates, and wasting $100's of billions on subsidy..

I mean, if the payback is 162 years, then we should start today, and in 162 years, we'll start getting payback, and every century after that gives us MORE payback, yes? It just has no immediate value in the short term.<br /><br />However, as others have said, I do have some concern with putting 'new' land under cultivation. That's one of the reasons that, at least for electricity (and possibly, for other energy uses), I favor nuclear power - because nuclear has the smallest footprint of any low-GHG emissions energy source. Wind and Solar have potentially large-ish footprints. Biofuel definitely has a large footprint.<br /><br />Right now, it looks like it's not cost-competitive, but potentially with some further R&amp;D, we might even be able to synthesize carbon-neutral hydrocarbon fuels (gas, diesel, jet fuel, etc) from nuclear energy, for transportation use.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/19/science/19carb.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/19/scien ... .html?_r=0</a><!-- m -->

For example, a couple years ago, I know there were people doing research on various pyrolysis processes to take waste from the pulp and paper industry and transform some of it into a mixture of hydrocarbons that could then be fed into normal refineries and other light hydrocarbons that could be sold directly.<br /><br />Obviously, recycling all type of biological waste into fuel isn't the answer, but just because it doesn't work for some type of waste, it shouldn't necessarily be discarded altogether.

      Good read, but it is my general opinion that crop based fuels create more issues then they solve. By using farm lands to fuel our cars, we are using (and thus consuming nutrients in) our own farmlands and directly competing against ourselves for food. <br /><br />Nothing good can come from this in my humble opinion. Unless of course, you seek only a monetary profit.

The whole point is to convert one form of energy into another more portable form. In fact, most means of lessening the environmental impact of production waste energy.<br /><br />Bio-fuel should be done from reclaimed material, as long as that is the best option for using it (as opposed to fertilizer). The numbers just don't work when you want to scale it to become the sole fossil fuel replacement. Complicating the problem is that if we relegate it to a niche fuel, it becomes harder to utilize it for the best use cases (rapid refuel for long haul). Maybe the (cross-country) rail system would be the best place to use it then.

      Honestly, I never thought of biofuels as being particularly beneficial to the environment. I always thought their promise was simply to supplant dwindling, finite fossil fuel supplies with a renewable source of fuel.

That said, to answer your question,<br /><br />1) A lot of biofuel research started when solar PV was much more expensive, just a few years ago.<br />2) Solar PV cost isn't yet close to zero. It just looks that way when you start your chart back when it was extremely expensive.<br />3) Liquid biofuels can be used as drop-in replacements for fossil fuels in ships/trucks/airplanes and electricity can't. Though you can make liquid fuels from air, water, and electricity too, and the efficiency with PV is still higher than growing crops.<br />4) Biomass burned in stationary power plants lets you manage energy output without adding storage. Though falling electricity storage costs also make the benefit here questionable.<br />5) The agriculture lobby is powerful so approaches that funnel more money to big farms get political support disproportionate to their benefits.<br /><br />Solar PV is unquestionably more efficient at capturing sunlight even if you have to add another fuel synthesis stage to make diesel or alcohol from the electricity. I don't know if the cost is lower yet; it's hard to normalize the different subsidies in play across different approaches.

No other nuclear plant design anywhere on earth has the unique combination of bad design decisions on top of bad design decisions that Chernobyl had.<br /><br />But, the reason I bring up Chernobyl is that, largely, the area around Chernobyl is thriving with wildlife, so it's hard to see how, ultimately, Nuclear is any bad threat to the environment.</div><br /><br />The point was Nuclear isn't the panacea we're looking for.<br /><br />There are serious problems with Nuclear that might be solved with careful planning, etc.  Yes, it does deserve to be in our fossil fuel free future but I'm tired of seeing &quot;Just use Nuclear and all our problems will be solved.&quot;<br /><br />It won't.</div><br /><br />There is no panacea - but Nuclear is a viable and workable solution that can provide as much energy as we need, at reasonable prices per-kWh (yes, nuclear is famous for cost overruns in building plants - much of that, by the way, caused by a nearly constantly changing regulatory environment which requires plant operators and design firms to make costly changes to designs AFTER construction has already started OR completed).<br /><br />But, all it takes is for us to get one or two designs 'set in stone', so to speak, that are safe, reliable, and can be built on time, on budget, anywhere, and at a reasonable cost, and start building them, and we will have lots of affordable energy.<br /><br />The estimated Levelized Cost of Electricity from nuclear is almost the same as coal,  slightly higher than advanced natural gas (which, currently, is very, very cheap in the US - so slightly higher than very cheap is still pretty cheap), slightly more expensive than on-shore wind (but is more reliable, which has a value), and way cheaper than off-shore wind or either Solar PV or Solar Thermal.<br /><br />Source for cost-related statements:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/electricity_generation.cfm">http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/electr ... ration.cfm</a><!-- m -->

      I think this is an area ripe for GMOs. Develop plants that could absorb more carbon dioxide or develop seeds with more useful oils (remember, oils are used to create things like plastics, not just fuel). GMOs aren't just useful as food crops. It's time to stop being afraid of them.

It's a similar process to break down cellulose into sugars and fermenting them into alcohol for fuel usage.<br /><br />Corn, grains, etc can be malted to naturally produce the enzymes to break down the starch to sugars. Cellulose, however, is a pretty tough cookie to split, enzymes have to be created and the cellulose material has to be mashed up and passed thru enzymatic reactors to get to a starch, then it's relative cake from there.<br /><br />Don't quote me on all of this, it's coming up on 10 years now since I did that, but at the end of the project, we came to the conclusion that it's great, *if* it can be done. However, there are many more advances/processes that need further progression before it'll be feasible, not to mention massive scale-up of the enzymes necessary to break down cellulose.<br /><br />Just a small portion of a wiki article that highlights the problem with cellulose derived ethanol:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulosic_ethanol#Enzyme-cost_barrier">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulosic ... st_barrier</a><!-- m -->

Its lowish quality and its so heavily dispersed that sending trucks around to collect it eats up a huge percentage of the returns. OTOH processing on-site isn't economical either for basically the same reason.

For example, a couple years ago, I know there were people doing research on various pyrolysis processes to take waste from the pulp and paper industry and transform some of it into a mixture of hydrocarbons that could then be fed into normal refineries and other light hydrocarbons that could be sold directly.<br /><br />Obviously, recycling all type of biological waste into fuel isn't the answer, but just because it doesn't work for some type of waste, it shouldn't necessarily be discarded altogether.</div><br /><br />Sure, when you're talking about some types of industrial operations you may find suitable waste streams. Even in some limited cases there are probably agricultural operations that qualify, or could with some modest changes to their procedures. The bulk of what is called 'field waste' or other similar materials though are simply not really worth collecting.
