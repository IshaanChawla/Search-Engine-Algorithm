<P>As well as the PHP comparison operators you saw earlier, there's also something 
  called Logical Operators. You typically use these when you want to test more 
  than one condition at a time. For example, you could check to see whether the 
  username and password are correct from the same If Statement. Here's the table 
  of these Operands.</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/logic_operators.png" alt="PHP Logic Operators"></P>
<P>The new Operands are rather strange, if you're meeting them for the first time. 
  A couple of them even do the same thing! They are very useful, though, so here's 
  a closer look.</P>
<p>The <b>&amp;&amp;</b> Operator<br>
  The &amp;&amp; symbols mean AND. Use this if you need both values to be true, 
  as in our username and password test. After all, you don't want to let people 
  in if they just get the username right but not the password! Here's an example:</p>
<p class="indent_small">$username ='user';<br>
  $password ='password';</p>
<p class="indent_small">if ($username =='user' &amp;&amp; $password =='password') 
  {</p>
<p class="indent_big">print(&quot;Welcome back!&quot;);</p>
<p class="indent_small">}<br>
  else {</p>
<p class="indent_big">print(&quot;Invalid Login Detected&quot;);</p>
<p class="indent_small">}</p>
<p>The if statement is set up the same, but notice that now two conditions are 
  being tested:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$username =='user' &amp;&amp; $password =='password</p>
<p>This says, &quot;If username is correct AND the password is ok, too, then let 
  them in&quot;. Both conditions need to go between the round brackets of your 
  if statement.</p>
<p>The <b>| |</b> Operator<br>
  The two straight lines mean OR. Use this symbol when you only need one of your 
  conditions to be true. For example, suppose you want to grant a discount to 
  people if they have spent more than 100 pounds OR they have a special key. Else 
  they don't get any discount. You'd then code like this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">$total_spent =100;<br>
  $special_key ='SK12345';</p>
<p class="indent_small">if ($total_spent ==100 | | $special_key =='SK12345') {</p>
<p class="indent_big">print(&quot;Discount Granted!&quot;);</p>
<p class="indent_small">}<br>
  else {</p>
<p class="indent_big">print(&quot;No discount for you!&quot;);</p>
<p class="indent_small">}</p>
<p>This time we're testing two conditions and only need ONE of them to be true. 
  If either one of them is true, then the code gets executed. If they are both 
  false, then PHP will move on.</p>
<p><b>AND</b> and <b>OR</b><br>
  These are the same as the first two! AND is the same as &amp;&amp; and OR is 
  the same as ||. There is a subtle difference, but as a beginner, you can simply 
  replace this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$username =='user' &amp;&amp; $password =='password</p>
<p>With this</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$username =='user' AND $password =='password</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$total_spent ==100 | | $special_key =='SK12345'</p>
<p>With this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$total_spent ==100 OR $special_key =='SK12345'</p>
<p>It's up to you which you use. AND is a lot easier to read than &amp;&amp;. 
  OR is a lot easier to read than ||.</p>
<p>The difference, incidentally, is to do with Operator Precedence. We touched 
  on this when we discussed variables, earlier. Logical Operators have a pecking 
  order, as well. The full table is coming soon!<br>
</p>
<p><b>XOR</b><br>
  You probably won't need this one too much. But it's used when you want to test 
  if one value of two is true but NOT both. If both values are the same, then 
  PHP sees the expression as false. If they are both different, then the value 
  is true. Suppose you had to pick a winner between two contestants. Only one 
  of them can win. It's an XOR situation!</p>
<p class="indent_small">$contestant_one = true;<br>
  $contestant_two = true;</p>
<p class="indent_small">if ($contestant_one XOR $contestant_two) {</p>
<p class="indent_big">print(&quot;Only one winner!&quot;);</p>
<p class="indent_small">}<br>
  else {</p>
<p class="indent_big">print(&quot;Both can't win!&quot;);</p>
<p class="indent_small">}</p>
<p>See if you can guess which of the two will print out, before running the script.</p>
<p><span class="pColor">The <b>! </b>Operator</span><br>
  This is known as the NOT operator. You use it test whether something is NOT 
  something else. You can also use it to reverse the value of a true or false 
  value. For example, you want to reset a variable to true, if it's been set to 
  false, and vice versa. Here's some code to try:</p>
<p class="TextIndent1">$test_value = false;</p>
<p class="TextIndent1">if ($test_value == false) {</p>
<p class="indent_big">print(!$test_value);</p>
<p class="TextIndent1">}</p>
<p>The code above will print out the number 1! (You'll see why when we tackle 
  Boolean values below.) What we're saying here is, &quot;If $test_value is false 
  then set it to what it's NOT.&quot; What it's NOT is true, so it will now get 
  this value. A bit confused? It's a tricky one, but it can come in handy!<br>
</p>
<p>In the next part, we'll take a look at Boolean values.</p>
