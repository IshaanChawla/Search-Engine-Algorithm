    <p>In the wake of the unexplained crash of an A400M troop and cargo transport plane in Spain on May 9, Airbus has ordered a review of the software that controls the turboprop engines of that aircraft model. The crash killed a Spanish flight test crew and has led to the grounding of British, German, and Turkish A400Ms already in service. The French military has also restricted the use of its six Airbus transports.</p>
<p>Airbus has asked its military customers to conduct checks of the software in the electronic control unit (ECU) of the engines. "To avoid potential risks in any future flights, Airbus Defence and Space has informed the operators about necessary actions to take," Airbus executives announced in an official statement.</p>
<p>The A400M was developed as European replacement for the C-130 military transport. The aircraft, assembled in Spain, was a joint program of seven NATO countries; Airbus' contract for the program had a price tag of over $22 billion. Delays in delivery of the A400M led to cost overruns and a reshuffling of Airbus's management.</p>
<p>Problems with development of the engines for the aircraft—the largest turboprop engines ever built for NATO—and the certification of the software at the heart of the aircraft's engine control system were significant contributors to those delays, holding up the delivery of the aircraft for three years. Problems with integrating military systems into the aircraft have delayed full delivery of the aircraft even further; the Spanish aircraft that crashed was conducting predelivery test flights.</p>
<p>Airbus apparently found a "quality" problem in the ECU software that caused an anomaly in engine operations during its own testing in the wake of the crash. The software check "is a precautionary measure which is part of our continued airworthiness activities," an <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/19/us-airbus-a400m-idUSKBN0O417720150519">Airbus spokeswoman told Reuters</a>.</p>

Avionics systems are pretty thoroughly vetted before they ever see service and are probably some of the better vetted hardware and software in existence.

The software check &quot;is a precautionary measure which is part of our continued airworthiness activities,&quot; an Airbus spokeswoman told Reuters.</div><br /><br />It does not sound like Airbus has found the root cause of the A400M crash yet. It is also possible they never will find the reason for the crash. There has to be some heavy pressure from upper management to pin this down conclusively considering the massive budget overruns the platform is carrying.<br /><br />I don't blame Brits, Germans, and Turks for grounding the planes. If they can't take corrective measures to avoid future accidents, there is no point in flying them unless it is an emergency.

      Being an aficionado of &quot;<a href="https://www.pinterest.com/remodman/aviation-heavy-metal/" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">heavy metal</a>&quot;, knowing that one can create aircraft that are generally safe, efficient and durable without all the fancy stuff that increases the complexity (and the number of points of failure), I've often wondered why no aircraft companies are opting for less complex systems.<br /><br />Much of the time I think it's a matter of increasing the profit margins. After all, a more complex system takes longer to develop, test and certify, keeping the gravy train running on what would otherwise be a shorter contract life.  But with various systems, it appears to be reaching the point of diminishing returns - so much complexity that durability and reliability are negatively impacted.<br /><br />I'm thinking of the LCS's, the F-35, the F-22 and most of the bigger ticket systems out there - not to mention some of the newer aircraft coming out of Boeing and Airbus.  They're all plagued with bugs, many can't yet do what they were intended to do or have failures of systems (like battery fires) and many of them have been in development and/or testing for three times longer than the U.S's involvement in World War Two.<br /><br />It begs the question, at what point (if ever) will increasing the complexity be seen as merely adding a detrimental nuance to the overall project?<br /><br />Because it's going to happen eventually, if we haven't already passed that point.  Sometimes, simpler is &quot;better&quot; in a relative sense.  And with the tech we can use to design them and prototype them and test them, with a focus on keeping things simple, it shouldn't take decades (and cost trillions) to bring something from concept to production.

And there have been no shortage of vehicle development delays to point at over the last couple of decades.<br /><br />Thing is, this is by no means a recent development - look at the C-5 Galaxy for an example back in the 60's, or the Bradley Fighting Vehicle in the 70's/early 80's. I think the suggestion that it's all part of a plot to increase contractor profits by increasing development time is malarky at best. Certainly in the case of the A380 and 787 - Boeing and Airbus only get paid for shipping aircraft, so any developmental delays come right out of their pocketbook.<br /><br />Instead, I'd argue that this is the result of trying to push the envelope further than current tech can comfortably support - the specs are stringent enough that a lot of R&amp;D work has to be incorporated into the development phase. As support, I'd point out the counterexamples of projects that did well, arguably because they set goals that were stringent, but were relaxed in common-sense ways when they appeared to be pushing the limits too hard. The A-10 is a classic example - look at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.airvectors.net/ava10_1.html">http://www.airvectors.net/ava10_1.html</a><!-- m --> :<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Douglas had actually tried to develop a turboprop follow-on to the Skyraider named the &quot;A2D-1 Skyshark&quot; in the 1950s, and it had been one of the worst aircraft the firm ever built, plagued with continuous development problems. It never entered production. To be sure, the turboprops available in the early 1950s were notoriously troublesome in themselves, but even the much more mature turboprops available in the late 1960s didn't seem to fit the AX very well. Fortunately, there was a new option, in the form of the &quot;high-bypass turbofan&quot;. &lt;snip&gt; The high-bypass turbofan provided good fuel economy at low speeds, and so it began to seem like a very attractive option for the AX. There was the difficulty that most of the early high-bypass turbofans were big engines designed for big aircraft, but there was no inherent obstacle in scaling down the technology for smaller aircraft. The USAF helped accommodate the use of high-bypass turbofans by tweaking the AX requirements toward a higher speed that was more in line with the optimum for such engines and by not demanding true &quot;short takeoff &amp; landing (STOL)&quot; performance, which would have imposed additional overhead such as thrust reversers.</div><br /><br />So they pushed the envelope by using high-bypass turbofans, but they modified the requirements to keep development within sensible limits.

      Interesting... A bit off-topic, but in Canada in 2008 there were a bunch of (proven) C-17 and C-130's purchased for the air force, and the opposition made a big deal that but would have been better to sign on for A-400M's  instead, which would due the duty of both. Delivery was supposed to be 2012 for the A-400M's at the time.  Fortunately the government didn't change in the election around that time, or we would be stuck with this flying turkey ( Canadian governments tend to reverse military procurement decisions of previous governments on assuming power).<br /><br />Edit: The engines were to be from Pratt&amp;Witney, Canadian division, until Canada decided not to sign on, at which point they were changed to a different supplier in Europe. Airbus' preference was P&amp;W Canada, but the decision was made by politicians (source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/european-business/airbus-shares-fall-after-a400m-military-plane-crash/article24371421/">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-o ... e24371421/</a><!-- m --> )

Are you looking for better fuel efficiency? Longer run times between maintenance requirements. More durable power units? Those are all common attributes for newer engine, and yes they do require a complete engine management system over carburetors. Profit margins have nothing to do with enabling better engine performance envelopes. A carburetor based solution will never successfully meet or beat the performance requirements of an ECU equipped variant.<br /><br />As everything increases in complexity, e.g. TV signals go from 240 lines to 1080p to 1440p, they require more effort. Not all are better at the development. Nations and companies both can be the problem.<br /><br />The poster commenting on the procurement issues as well as the one from Canada explaining the change in engine manufacture are far more telling than your enjoyment of carburetted engines.<br /><br />Adding in the Boeing battery fire is a classic red herring, BTW. It is not logically connected to your actual argument. The battery fires were not caused by ECU/controllers or complexity of design. The original design had a run away thermal issue, which is possible on many battery solutions (search for laptop fires). The design missed that the thermal over heat in one cell could escalate. What Boeing and the FAA failed to do was a full on battery failure test. Test until destruction as it were. All to save time and money no doubt.

      In response to the &quot;is simpler better&quot; comments... there are very good reasons the industry has largely moved from hydro-mechanical control systems to electronic, and them mostly have to with weight and performance. An electric servo, while more complex than a hydraulic servo, is much, much lighter. <br /><br />For example, look at the difference between the F404 engine (which powers the &quot;legacy&quot; F/A-18 Hornet) and the F414 (which powers the Super Hornet). They come from a common ancestor and are very similar. However, one of the major differences is that the F404 has a hydromechanical control and the F414 has a FADEC. The F414 also has 4,000 more pounds of thrust. That's obviously not entirely due to the FADEC, but moving to a lighter, more efficient, but more complex system, helped enable that. <br /><br />Re: complexity getting in the way of what a system is supposed to do... I'm not a rah-rah kind of guy when it comes to a military system, but the complex, expensive, and delayed F-22 still has 180+ more highly capable units in the field. I believe all of its competitors (T-50, J-20, J-31) are just breaking double digits (combined), and all of those are test assets. There are plenty of reasons to criticize our western defense contractors, but it's not like the competition is lapping them. They're running into the same issues everyone else in the industry is. And it's not like there's a country out there that has decide to just churn out a bunch of modernized-but-simple MiG-21s as a solution. Everyone is still working on advanced derivatives and concepts for their combat aircraft. If the simple-and-easy combat aircraft is a market inefficiency, none of the players (worldwide) has picked up on it.

Its the same with engines, a decent ECU can deal with different octane ratings and even ethanol content. If certain parameters are met it can limit the engine into a low powered safe mode preventing damage. And thats just scratching the surface. Try that with carbs!

The main motivation is that the kind of vehicles and equipment modern armed forces want to tactical airlift has grown a bit beyond what a C-130 can carry.<br /><br />Another problem is that Airbus signed a fixed cost contract, so all of these delays were going to come out of their pocket, not out of the clients pockets. Renegotiating funding for the program has been complicated and it's 1 billion EUR in the red for Airbius. So they aren't exactly throwing money at the problem.<br /><br />Finally note that these transport aircraft are nowhere as simple do design as it might look.<br />Kelly Johnson (of U-2 and SR-71 fame) famously said that signing the C-130 contract would doom Lockheed. It ended making them a fortune, but shows how challenging the C-130 actually was.<br />Both the C-130 and C-160 required the development of exceptionally powerful turboprop engines.<br />The C-17 is also an expensive piece of kit, capable of landing  with main battle tank inside into insanely short runways.
