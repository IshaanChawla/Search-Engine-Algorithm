    <p>I attended the entire Silk Road trial in a New York federal courthouse earlier this year, and while there I counted no less than four filmmakers intending to make movies about the saga: two documentaries, at least one screenwriter working on a feature film, and another writing a TV miniseries.</p>
<p>The first documentary, Alex Winter's <em>Deep Web</em>, is complete. It's on the festival circuit now, having recently played at San Francisco's International Film Festival. And people beyond the Bay can see <em>Deep Web </em>when<em> </em>the film has its national television premiere at the end of this month on the Epix movie channel.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,<em> Deep Web</em> isn't a good movie. The documentary by Winter, who also created a film about Napster called <em>Downloaded,</em> tells the story of the government's case against Ross Ulbricht from a point of view that's so obsequious to Ulbricht and his mother—a key source for Winter—that it may as well be a home movie.</p>
<p>The government's actions and tactics, especially an unproven but suspected hack of the Silk Road server, are absolutely fair game for debate. But the idea that Ulbricht wasn't the "Dread Pirate Roberts" (DPR) who ran the site is hard to take seriously at this point.</p>
<p>A jury <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/02/ulbricht-guilty-in-silk-road-online-drug-trafficking-trial/">convicted Ulbricht in February</a> on drug trafficking and other charges. That verdict, reached after three hours of deliberation, came not because Ulbricht wasn't allowed to make his case—a nonsensical trope still touted by his lawyer, family, and core supporters—but because his seized computer was literally full of Silk Road business records, chat logs with top SR admins, and a personal journal describing how he built the site.</p>
<p>The film doesn't mount a convincing argument for anything, but by toeing the "Free Ross" party line so dogmatically, <em>Deep Web</em> is unintentionally revealing. It's a neat encapsulation of what some of Silk Road's most fervent fans believe about the site, about Ulbricht, and about themselves.</p>
<p>The movie gives lots of airtime to friends and family who explain that Ulbricht couldn't possibly have been involved in anything like a murder-for-hire. The evidence suggesting he did—personal messages collected from the server, chat logs on his computer—are simply avoided. Instead, we see interview after interview with the countervailing "evidence," which essentially consists of people saying that Ross is a really nice guy.</p>
<p>"For him to say, 'I'm going to put out a hit on someone,' is ludicrous," says one anonymous vendor who speaks on camera, who claims multiple people used the DPR account. "I can see it being another Silk Road worker, getting all egotistical and crazy and maniacal."</p>
<p>"[A]nyone who knows Ross knows that's insane," was the take of Ulbricht's friend René Pinnell, who answered a few questions for Winters via e-mail.</p>
<p>Ulbricht will likely never be tried for any murder-for-hire charge, nor should he be—five of the "hits" appear to be a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/02/the-hitman-scam-dread-pirate-roberts-bizarre-murder-for-hire-attempts/">scheme arranged by a scam artist</a>, while another was set up by a DEA agent who's <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/03/two-feds-who-investigated-silk-road-accused-of-stealing-from-it-too/">now facing criminal charges himself</a>. In the court of public opinion, though, the attempts are damning facts.</p>
<h2>Unprecedented access</h2>
<p>Silk Road had a real camaraderie about it, something which stood out to anyone who read the site's public forum posts. "Sure there were illegal things going on, but this was a real community of like-minded people," another Silk Road vendor says early on in the film.</p>
<p>As the project soared, DPR's voice on the forums became boisterous and triumphal. "In a very real sense, we've won the war on drugs," he wrote in one post quoted in the movie.</p>
<p><figure class="image right medium" style="width:300px"><a href="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Deep-Web-31.jpg" class="enlarge" data-height="1198" data-width="1821"><img src="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Deep-Web-31-300x197.jpg" width="300" height="197" srcset="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Deep-Web-31-640x421.jpg 2x"></a><figcaption class="caption"><div class="caption-text"><a href="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Deep-Web-31.jpg" class="enlarge" data-height="1198" data-width="1821">Enlarge</a> <span class="sep">/</span> Lyn Ulbricht</div> <div class="caption-credit">Deep Web</div></figcaption></figure>Few journalists knew the Silk Road site better than reporter Andy Greenberg, a source for <em>Deep Web</em> whose excellent work covering Silk Road at <em>Forbes</em> and <em>Wired</em> landed him the only published interview with DPR. Greenberg's thoughts on the site and the trial appear throughout <em>Deep Web</em>, and these are some of the only segments that provide real insight. Greenberg is the lone person in the movie to say, on camera, that he's actually convinced by the government's case that Ulbricht did run Silk Road—a statement of the very obvious that <em>Deep Web</em>, to its credit, does finally sneak in.</p>
<p>But exploring the Silk Road's "culture" falls quickly to the wayside as the film becomes a platform for Ulbricht's parents. Their view was (and is) that Ulbricht was "tried and convicted in the media." In their view, <em>nothing</em> has been proven.</p>
<p>"I don't know what's happened to the presumption of innocence in this country," says Lyn Ulbricht.</p>
<p>Is it asking too much to think that Winter, with his extraordinary access, could have asked the Ulbrichts one hard question? Such as: what did Ross Ulbricht <em>tell you </em>he was doing from 2011 to 2013? There's no evidence that Ulbricht ever had a normal job or paycheck while he was running Silk Road, traveling the world, and then settling in San Francisco. It would have been fascinating to get even a little insight into the family dynamics here, but the storyline is well-prepared and offers few surprises.</p>
<p>The movie rightly mentions that the government has never properly described how it gained access to the Silk Road server; it's a serious issue that raises real concerns about whether the FBI overreached during the investigation. But the movie skips over the fact that Ulbricht and his lawyer essentially <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/02/op-ed-ross-ulbricht-got-a-fair-trial-but-not-a-fair-investigation/">turned down a judge's repeated offers</a> to challenge that evidence. To do that, Ulbricht would have had to admit to having a "privacy interest" in that server. It's a telling omission.</p>
<p>Like Ulbricht's defenders, <em>Deep Web</em> doesn't quite say Ross is innocent, but it dares the viewer to believe he's guilty.</p>
<h2>Drug warriors</h2>
<p><em>Deep Web</em> falls into the same intellectual paradox as hard-core Ulbricht supporters—and yes, they do exist. On the one hand, they maintain that Ulbricht's guilt has never been proven. On the other hand, they want credit for Silk Road being the boldest form of activism against an overreaching drug war and the erosion of personal privacy.</p>
<p>I am personally sympathetic to those issues, as I'm sure many other viewers of this film will be, but <em>Deep Web</em> actually shows the great disservice that Silk Road and its supporters have done to both causes.</p>
<p>Winter got plenty of time with people working on the frontlines of Internet privacy, from Christopher Soghoian at the ACLU to Cindy Cohn at EFF. But their thoughts on these broader issues are inappropriately rolled into a narrative about a drug-dealing website run by—well, who can really say? And it would be a mistake to believe that those interviewed by Winter necessarily share his view of Silk Road. One person interviewed for the movie told me that it had been presented to her as simply being about the "dark Web" generally.</p>
<p>The connection between Ulbricht's case and these privacy activists is never really explained. It's a kind of innocence by association.</p>
<p>That disingenuousness becomes even more glaring when <em>Deep Web</em> goes on to interview people with a serious critique of the drug war, including Neil Franklin, a longtime Maryland state trooper who now heads up a group called Law Enforcement Against Prohibition. In his sound bites, Franklin points out some hard truths about the drug war, like the fact that it has become big money for both law enforcement and private corrections corporations. But the movie pivots from serious activists like Franklin to two other people who have learned to hate the drug war—Ross' parents, Lyn and Kirk Ulbricht.</p>
<p>"So many people have been victimized by the drug war," says Kirk Ulbricht in one interview. "It's a giant mess, and it's a story that needs telling. We've got a pulpit and a way to tell it."</p>
<p>The movie's suggestion-by-proxy that Ross Ulbricht was somehow an activist seeking to end the drug war isn't just wrong, it's insulting to activists. His idealism is tainted, not just by the money he collected from drug dealers, but by the fact that he hid his actions and lied to everyone around him. Ulbricht didn't want to bother to convince people that his market-for-everything was a worthy idea—he just wanted to be famous for creating the market. He wanted to be special.</p>
<p>Take a hypothetical example: Let's say I go outside my apartment in Oakland and mark off a few city blocks as a "freedom market" where anything can be bought and sold—I just need a 10 percent cut of all transactions to maintain the marketplace. (Suspend your disbelief to imagine this can be done without violence.) No surprise, it's mostly drugs that are sold in the market. The goods are high quality and sold peacefully. My "freedom market," when it works right, arguably does reduce harm, making sellers and buyers safer. It also inarguably will make me rich, as long as I get my 10 percent cut.</p>
<p>But running my hypothetical street market <em>doesn't</em> mean I am striking a nail in the coffin of the drug war. Likely, it's just the opposite. A market designed to hide from the law is a great excuse for law enforcement to double down on the severity of enforcement and punishment.</p>
<p>Activists are the people like Franklin and LEAP, doing the difficult work of trying to change hearts and minds on an issue that's still deeply divisive. Real "harm reduction" is being done in homeless shelters, methadone clinics, and needle exchanges by caring people who are almost universally overworked and underpaid. They know the price being paid by our society for a drug war gone astray. They publish papers, they practice medicine, they offer therapy, they testify to legislators—and the war continues. None of them has $18 million in Bitcoin to show for their efforts. Changing the law is a lot harder, and a lot less lucrative, than creating a website that just ignores it.</p>

      Is anyone else reminded by the reaction to Ulbricht, of the case against Hans Reiser for murdering his wife?  Of course, before he led the cops to her grave, there was some possibility for doubt, but I distinctly recall a small hoard of Reiser fans claiming he was absolutely innocent, he was being railroaded by the cops, that they shouldn't have been investigating him.<br /><br />Seriously, it amazes me how people can &quot;know&quot; without a doubt that a person is innocent - even when they're guilty!

      I agree with the author's assessment of the merits (or lack thereof) of Ulbricht's defenders. I'm sure a good portion of them are simply people who want hard drugs to be easier and safer to procure. And I've no doubt that others genuinely are in it for sound ideological reasons, but in any case they're backing the wrong pony.

      I don't disagree with much except for the implication that Silk Road wasn't a major source of harm reduction.  Silk Road truly was one of the best methods of harm reduction in existence.  No, seriously.  The greatest dangers from the drugs are, harmful impurities, variation in concentration, dealing in a black market, and law enforcement.  Silk Road dramatically reduced the danger of all four of those things.  It wasn't done for altruistic reasons, but it did accomplish harm reduction.  The very evidence that this is the case was its popularity.  People saw it as a safer alternative to doing these transaction in meat space, and they were almost certainly correct for believing so.<br /><br />I'm not saying you should go out and get yourself a meth or heroin addiction even if the stuff is legal; but if you are going to die of even those two rather nasty drugs, it will almost certainly be when one of the four things I pointed out gets you.  Those are going to kill you much faster than the drug will.  The black market is what makes drugs so dangerous.  Silk Road was a safer black market.<br /><br />Ross isn't a saint.  He wasn't trying to reduce harm; or if he was he was intent on making himself rich in the process.  He certainly tried to literally murder people.  He should be in jail for that.  That however doesn't taint Silk Road itself.  The best solution is an end to the drugs and focus on full legalization on relatively harmless drugs and a medical approach to actually harmful drugs.  That isn't going to happen any time soon, so for now, a world with Silk Road is a better world than a world without.<br /><br />edit: I have got to say, I find these threads incredibly disappointing.  The American hard on for &quot;law and order&quot; despite gross injustice of brutally enforcing drug laws is really depressing.  The enthusiasm for jailing millions of people and destroying literally tens of millions of lives at home in the war on drugs is awful.  The fact that we can rational the terrible destruction we have caused in places like Mexico where hundreds of thousands have died fighting our worthless war on drugs is even worse.  The down votes speak for themselves though; drug users are not people worth caring about, people dying in foreign nations for our stupid &quot;war&quot; on drugs are not worth caring about, and the tens of millions of Americans who have had their lived utterly destroyed by our legal system are not worth caring about.  It is so horribly depressing to see that we have learned literally nothing from alcohol and marijuana prohibition.  It has taken nearly a century to start to realize the insanity of marijuana prohibition.  It will probably take another century before we get smart on all the other worthless and destructive prohibitions we have, and it will cost literally billions of destroyed lives before we get there.  Depressing.

      Criminalizing drug use is like criminalizing gay sex, or criminalizing where you sit on a bus. That is the major issue which needs to be addressed. <br /><br />People can use their body however they wish. That is the thing. People inherently know this to be true. That means overeating, orgies, running marathons or B.A.S.E. jumping. Or taking drugs. <br /><br />Still we live in the past. Where a central authority believes it knows better than the citizen himself what that citizen should put into his body. This authority knows so well, is so wise, that it does not just educate and advise, it forces the citizen to comply. Forces to the point of prison. <br /><br />Utterly absurd. <br /><br />Embrace personal responsibility and personal freedom and support the end to criminalizing drug use. The end.<br /><br />Sorry but if you don't believe this to be true you are mired in the ignorance of the past as those who once criminalized gay sex. <br /><br />Free citizens can do as they wish with their own bodies. Embrace this now or live in ignorance.

      I don't understand why they have to take such a stance with a story like this. The facts of the case are better than any holly wood drama. Just give us the facts in a nice condensed easy to understand form and you have a good movie. Bit coin, drugs, crooked cops, underground doctors, tropical vacation trips, its literally ALL there.

      <div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But running my hypothetical street market doesn't mean I am striking a nail in the coffin of the drug war. Likely, it's just the opposite. A market designed to hide from the law is a great excuse for law enforcement to double down on the severity of enforcement and punishment.<br /><br />Activists are the people like Franklin and LEAP, doing the difficult work of trying to change hearts and minds on an issue that's still deeply divisive.</div><br />I have no comment on whether Ulbricht himself or his activities qualify as activist, but the above is not correct. Activism is not limited to activities that only try to persuade the masses. Activism absolutely can take the form of simply achieving some desired ends, or specific instances of a broader goal. For example an anti-whaling activist could, instead of going around petitioning for a law against whaling, go out in a boat and try to physically stop whalers. Whether he cares to get publicity for his stunt or only cares about stopping some particular whale killings does not change whether he is behaving as an activist.<br /><br />Or an anti-slavery activist might, say, run a stop on the Underground Railroad. This is activism but it certainly requires <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> getting publicity for the activism.<br /><br />Agorism and Crypto anarchy are both activist in nature, and their aim is not to persuade the masses, but simply to create practical realities. Crypto anarchy aims at using cryptographic technologies that make it practically impossible for governments to impose certain restrictions, regardless of public support. Agorism aims to provide markets outside government control, again regardless of public support.

Likely, it's just the opposite. A market designed to hide from the law is a great excuse for law enforcement to double down on the severity of enforcement and punishment.<br /><br />Activists are the people like Franklin and LEAP, doing the difficult work of trying to change hearts and minds on an issue that's still deeply divisive.</div><br />I have no comment on whether Ulbricht himself or his activities qualify as activist, but the above is not correct. Activism is not limited to activities that only try to persuade the masses. Activism absolutely can take the form of simply achieving some desired ends, or achieving a specific instances of a broader goal. For example an anti-whaling activist could, instead of going around petitioning for a law against whaling, might go out in a boat and try to physically stop whalers. Whether he cares to get publicity for his stunt or only cares about stopping some particular whale killings does not change whether he is behaving as an activist.<br /><br />Or an anti-slavery activist might, say, run a stop on the Underground Railroad. This is activism but it certainly requires <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> getting publicity for the activism.<br /><br />Agorism and Crypto anarchy are both activist in nature, and their aim is not to persuade the masses, but simply to create practical realities. Crypto anarchy aims at using cryptographic technologies that make it practically impossible for governments to impose certain restrictions, regardless of public support. Agorism aims to provide markets outside government control, again regardless of public support.</div><br /><br />Thats one part that got me too.  Yes, Ulbricht may have not have been the preferred type of &quot;activist&quot;, however one of, if not THE most powerful form of protest, which at its heart is what activism is all about, is defiance.  DEFIANCE, not standing around with picket signs.  Not lobbying government and not necessarily taking ones possible valuable time and trying to help of convince others.  Defiance is at the root of all activism/civil disobedience, and by simply ignoring the laws and having a drug marketplace, Silk Road is both an act of defiance and therefore does represent real world activism as much as any LEAP campaign.

In my hypothetical neighborhood &quot;freedom market&quot; I dream up at the end of the piece, I argued that a well-functioning, peaceful (or even mostly peaceful) market will absolutely reduce harm. <br /><br />But it's a short-term gain, because blowing off the laws and the democratic process does long-term harm to the cause—whether it's legalizing such markets, or just rationalizing how we deal with them.</div><br /><br />I disagree. Both approaches help the cause. Just like with marijuana. Many many people blew off the laws and the democratic process and sold, used and distributed weed. I did it myself from 1972-1975. It all adds up to pushing the rights of free citizens forward. Its just a variation of civil disobedience. People should have the simple courage to do as they wish with their own bodies until society catches up with that basic fact.

He was caught red-handed with the laptop with all of DPR's info, had multiple instances where he just happened to be traveling to the same locations as DPR said he was travelling, and just so happened to have a LOT of bitcoins in his possession that came from Silk Road, despite not having an apparent job.  Despite your insistence that this didn't constitute hard evidence at all, and the prosecutor still had an uphill climb to prove guilt, the jury came back with a verdict in 3 hours.  And now the sour grapes, because your insistence on what constitutes &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; was hilariously incorrect, as everyone else here pointed out.<br /><br />The article has a very good point.  I wish the people insisting on Ulbricht's innocence would be asked the simple question of what they think he was doing for the years that he was running the site, and travelling around the world.  His parents and friends seem to be in some AMAZING denial about who he actually was.

That is the major issue which needs to be addressed. <br /><br />People can use their body however they wish. That is the thing. People inherently know this to be true. That means overeating, orgies, running marathons or B.A.S.E. jumping. Or taking drugs. <br /><br />Still we live in the past. Where a central authority believes it knows better than the citizen himself what that citizen should put into his body. This authority knows so well, is so wise, that it does not just educate and advise, it forces the citizen to comply. Forces to the point of prison. <br /><br />Utterly absurd. <br /><br />Embrace personal responsibility and personal freedom and support the end to criminalizing drug use. The end.<br /><br />Sorry but if you don't believe this to be true you are mired in the ignorance of the past as those who once criminalized gay sex. <br /><br />Free citizens can do as they wish with their own bodies. Embrace this now or live in ignorance.</div><br /><br />I mean, that's an opinion on how the world should work.  It's not necessarily an incorrect one, but you better recognize that is an opinion and not a fact.  Somehow we've had some pretty good civilizations over the past few thousand years without that ever being the way we operate.

Silk Road truly was one of the best methods of harm reduction in existence.  No, seriously.  The greatest dangers from the drugs are, harmful impurities, variation in concentration, dealing in a black market, and law enforcement.  Silk Road dramatically reduced the danger of all four of those things.  It wasn't done for altruistic reasons, but it did accomplish harm reduction.  The very evidence that this is the case was its popularity.  People saw it as a safer alternative to doing these transaction in meat space, and they were almost certainly correct for believing so.<br /><br />I'm not saying you should go out and get yourself a meth or heroin addiction even if the stuff is legal; but if you are going to die of even those two rather nasty drugs, it will almost certainly be when one of the four things I pointed out gets you.  Those are going to kill you much faster than the drug will.  The black market is what makes drugs so dangerous.  Silk Road was a safer black market.<br /><br />Ross isn't a saint.  He wasn't trying to reduce harm; or if he was he was intent on making himself rich in the process.  He certainly tried to literally murder people.  He should be in jail for that.  That however doesn't taint Silk Road itself.  The best solution is an end to the drugs and focus on full legalization on relatively harmless drugs and a medical approach to actually harmful drugs.  That isn't going to happen any time soon, so for now, a world with Silk Road is a better world than a world without.</div><br /><br />Whether or not there really is a total reduction in harm is debatable because there are more parties involved than just the customer and their dealer; they're just the last two links. For example, the ultimate source of cocaine is going to be some kind of violent group using that money to fund politically destabilizing activity. Because of this, it only became safe to visit Columbia recently, and only certain parts, partially because cocaine production moved to neighboring countries. There's a huge problem with drug cartel violence in Mexico, and they are largely funded by cocaine sales. It's the same with opium production in Afghanistan. <br /><br />No matter how safe the marketplace is, there are innocent people that are going to get hurt if the source of the drugs is a violent group.

In my hypothetical neighborhood &quot;freedom market&quot; I dream up at the end of the piece, I argued that a well-functioning, peaceful (or even mostly peaceful) market will absolutely reduce harm. <br />But it's a short-term gain, because blowing off the laws and the democratic process does long-term harm to the cause—whether it's legalizing such markets, or just rationalizing how we deal with them.</div><br />If you look at SR as civil disobedience toward drug laws because the War on Drugs has been way more harmful than actual drug use...</div><br /><br />Then you're a delusional optimist. SR was not started for any kind of &quot;protest&quot;. Someone saw a huge pile of cash available, and they wanted to be Scrooge McDuck. That's all.
