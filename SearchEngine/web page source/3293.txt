<P>You've been working with string functions in the <a href="php7p1.html">last 
  section</a>, and references to functions have been made in other sections. But 
  what is a function, and how do you create them? In this section, you'll find 
  out.</P>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is a Function?</h3>
<p>A function is just a segment of code, separate from the rest of your code. 
  You separate it because it's nice and handy, and you want to use it not once 
  but over and over. It's a chunk of code that you think is useful, and want to 
  use again. Functions save you from writing the code over and over. Here's an 
  example.</p>
<p>Suppose you need to check text from a textbox. You want to trim any blank spaces 
  from the left and right of the text that the user entered. So if they entered 
  this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3"><font color="#0000FF">&quot;</font><b> </b>Bill Gates<b> 
  </b><font color="#0000FF">&quot;</font></p>
<p>You want to turn it into this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3"><font color="#0000FF">&quot;</font>Bill Gates<font color="#0000FF">&quot;</font></p>
<p>But you also want to check if the user entered any text at all. You don't want 
  the textbox to be completely blank!</p>
<p>You can use the PHP inbuilt function called trim( ). Like this:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold">$user_text = <b>trim(</b> $_POST['text1'] <b>)</b>;</p>
<p>That will get rid of the white space in the text box. But it won't check if 
  the text box is blank. You can add an if statement for that:</p>
<p class="indent_big">if ($user_text == &quot;&quot;) {</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">error_message = &quot;Blank textbox detected&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent_big">}</p>
<p>But what if you have lots of textboxes on your form? You'd have to have lots 
  of if statements, and check each single variable for a blank string. That's 
  a lot of code to write!</p>
<p>Rather than do that, you can create a single function, with one if statement 
  that can be used for each blank string you need to check. Using a function means 
  there's less code for you to write. And it's more efficient. We'll see how to 
  write a function for the above scenario in a moment. But first, here's the basic 
  syntax for a function.</p>
<p class="indent_big">function function_name() {</p>
<p class="indent_big">}</p>
<p>So you start by typing the word <b>function</b>. You then need to come up with 
  a name for your function. You can call almost anything you like. It's just like 
  a variable name. Next, you type two round brackets ( ). Finally, you need the 
  two curly brackets as well { }. Whatever you function does goes between the 
  curly brackets. Here's a simple example that just print something out:</p>
<p class="indent_big">function display_error_message() {</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">print &quot;Error Detetceted&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent_big">}</p>
<p>In the example above, we've started with function. We've then called this particular 
  function <b>display_error_message</b>. In between the curly brackets, there 
  a print statement. Try it out with this script:</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;?PHP</p>
<p class="indent_big">function display_error_message( ) {</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">print &quot;Error Detetceted&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent_big">}</p>
<p class="indent_small">?&gt;</p>
<p>Run your script and see what happens. You should find that nothing happens!</p>
<p>The reason that nothing happened is because a function is a separate piece 
  of code. It doesn't run until you tell it to. Just loading the script won't 
  work. It's like those inbuilt functions you used, such as <b>trim</b>. You can't 
  use trim( ) unless you type out the name, and what you want PHP to trim. The 
  same applies to your own functions &#150; you have to &quot;tell&quot; PHP that 
  you want to use a function that you wrote. You do this by simply typing out 
  the name of your function. This is known as &quot;calling&quot; a function. 
  Try this new version of the script.</p>
<p class="TextIndent2">&lt;?PHP</p>
<p class="indent_big">function display_error_message() {</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">print &quot;Error Detetceted&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent_big">}</p>
<p class="indent_big">display_error_message( );</p>
<p class="TextIndent2">?&gt;</p>
<p>After the function, we've typed out the name again. This is enough to tell 
  PHP to run our code segment. Now change your code to this, and see what happens:</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;?PHP</p>
<p class="indent_big">display_error_message();</p>
<p class="indent_big">function display_error_message() {</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">print &quot;Error Detetceted&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent_big">}</p>
<p class="indent_small">?&gt;</p>
<p>If you have PHP 4 or above, you should see no difference &#150; the function 
  will still get executed with the name above or below the function. But for neatness 
  and readability's sake, it's better to put all of your function either at the 
  top or bottom of your scripts. Or better yet, in a separate PHP file. You can 
  then use another inbuilt function called &quot;Include&quot; (which we'll get 
  to soon)</p>
<p>In the next part, we'll take a look at something called Scope.</p>
